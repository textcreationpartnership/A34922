            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE common courſe of mans life (moſt ventrous and no leſs Worſhipful Knight) and their daily dealings, doe manifeſtly declare how variable they be, how wandring, how wavering, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and unconſtant; if Fortune, or rather God (to ſpeak Chriſtian-like) by bleſſing them as abundantly, ſo extraordinarily, and raiſing them, <hi>tanquam è pulvere &amp; luto,</hi> advance them to promotion. And no marvel though this be incident to the manners of men, ſeeing that Nature her ſelf in this point offendeth. For what is he, unleſs he be mortified, that is not naturally of an aſpiring minde? Imitating herein the property of the Ivie, which never ceaſeth climbing by degrees, <hi>Donec ipſam ſummitatem attigerit,</hi> till it be come to the very top. This fault being general, and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the judgement, ſpecially of the wiſe, might ſeem ſo much the more tollerable, if that men placed in preheminence, and ſitting like Hills over-looking the Valleys below, with their high calling and ſtately authority, had agreeable hearts. But ſome notwithſtanding their ſtate be ſingular, and indeed ſuch as that they may ſit down, take their eaſe, and ſay, <hi>Hic ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus eſto,</hi> do carry ſo baſe a mind, as that if I ſhould compare them to <hi>Aeſops</hi> Cock, preferring a Barley Corn before a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pearl, I ſhould not do amiſs. There is none but by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent obſervation may ſee this to be undoubted truth.</p>
            <p>In the taxing of which Engliſh and Out-landiſh fault, (for it is as common as the World is wide) I ſhould ſhew my ſelf no cunning Archer, to over-ſhoot the mark of your deſerved com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation:
<pb facs="tcp:102717:3"/>For although you have had Fortune holding the Baſon whilſt you waſhed your hands, and caſt the beſt chance of the Dice: yet for all that, ſuch is your contentment, you hoyſt not up the lofty ſail of ſelf-love, to ſwell with the wind of vain-glory, as vanting of any exploit which you have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved, <hi>Per tot Cyclopia ſaxa, per mundi ſcopulos, Scyllam, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamque Charibdim:</hi> But as you went out, ſo are you come home, familiar with your friends, courteous to your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, remembring all, forgetting none, ſtill of one mind, will, and affection, the proſperous event of your dangerous Voyage notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>Some one having paſſed a Sea of ſix dayes ſayling, or leſſe, (if leſs might be ſuppoſed) is ſo far in love with himſelf, and ſo indiſcreetly doteth over his own doings, at his return; that he maketh his Travel ordinary Table-talk, aggravating the matter ſo monſtrouſly, as if he had endured the very Labours of old <hi>Hercules.</hi> Another, <hi>Et terris jactatus &amp; alto,</hi> having ſeen the mighty Works of the Lord, and his Wonders in the Deep, and as it were meaſured with a pair of Compaſſes, (be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without offence) the globe of the World, <hi>post multa diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimina rerum,</hi> arriving to his native Soil, marvellouſly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from above, yet diſcovereth not the multitude of dangers, or rather death, wherewith he hath encountred. Which of theſe judge you, deſerveth the Trumpets plauſible ſound.</p>
            <p>I cannot therefore ſufficiently wonder at the equality of your Worſhips mind, which notwithſtanding ſo many tempeſts of perturbations, and ſharp ſurges of inward motions, continueth calm. And it doth me not a little good, firſt, to ſee you ſo fortunate; ſecondly, though that were enough to make you inſolent and diſdainful, the credit which you have gotten de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving (no doubt) even with the very beſt, that yet you contemn not the company, the acquaintance, the familiarity and conference, even of ſuch as by many degrees are your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours.</p>
            <p>This among other conſiderations of your courteous diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and friendly nature (being a mirrour in a Gentleman in this our proud arrogant Age) like a right Load-ſtone, drew me, an Iron lump, having in my hands a notable Work, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,

            <p>Which Work ſo perfected and brought into a reaſonable good form, as my little learning and leſs leiſure gave me leave, I am bold upon requeſt of the Tranſlator, being abſent, to make Dedicatory unto your Worſhip, and have added this Epiſtle of mine own, as a teſtimony of the unfained affection and hearty good will which I bear you (without preſumption be it ſpoken) not doubting how it ſhall be received, ſeeing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer preſentation thereof was ſo well liked. Beſeeching God to bleſs you, and the good Lady your Wife, and all yours, one with another, to proſper your proceedings, to further all your affairs: and that as hitherto you have had <hi>Vertue</hi> your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any Hiſtoriographers, both Poets and Orators, as well Prophane as Divine, have by Writing notified divers perſons with their Voyages and Adventures. Firſt, <hi>Juſtin</hi> and <hi>Diodore,</hi> of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> have made mention of the <hi>Argonautes</hi> Voyage by Sea: that is to ſay, of <hi>Jaſon</hi> and his Allies, <hi>Caſtor, Pollux, Hercules,</hi> and other Peers, to the Ile of <hi>Cholcos,</hi> to winne the Golden Fleece, which a great Dragon kept. Alſo <hi>Homer,</hi> a Greek Poet, writ in Verſe the wandring and Sea Voyage of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> and his Companions, at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the <hi>Trojan</hi> Wars. After him <hi>Virgil,</hi> a moſt elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Latine Poet, ſet down in Verſe the Voyage of <hi>Aeneas</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> with his fortunes, after the ſubverſion of <hi>Troy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if we come to the ſacred Hiſtories, we ſhall find, firſt, how <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> their going out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> into the Land of Promiſe, and of the two and forty Manſions that they made in the Deſarts, for the ſpace of forty yeers. And how the four Evangeliſts likewiſe moſt faithfully
<pb facs="tcp:102717:6"/>have written of the holy peregrination of the Bleſſed Son of God our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, who took upon him our fraile and humane nature. The ſelf ſame Saviour hath ſet down the Parable of the boluptuous Voyage of the prodigal Child, and his returne. S. <hi>Luke</hi> very notably and ſincerely hath delivered, in writing, the painful and holy perigrination of that great beſſed of Election Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> together with the great travel he took to preach the Goſpel, and the Faith of Ieſus Chriſt, to all the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>And now (by <hi>Gods grace</hi>) I mean to declare mine own Voyage and Adventures, much like to that of the Prodigall Child, who left his Fathers houſe, and ranged into ſtrange Countries, waſting all his goods, living licentiouſly: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he knew his lewdneſſe, he returned back to his Father, of whom he was very lovingly received. So I by great Folly counſelled, in abſenting my ſelf farre away (not only in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but alſo in mind) from God my Father and Creator, have waſted and conſumed all the goods which the ſame my God and Father had bountifully beſtowed upon me, in following bain pleaſures of this life. But in the End, I being inſpired with <hi>Divine grace,</hi> acknowledged mine effences; and leaking the dark Region of ſin and vanity, through the aid and conduction of <hi>Divine grace,</hi> am returned to mine Eternall Father, humbly requiring pardon and mercy; who of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable mercy hath lovingly received me. But how all this hath been done, I will declare unto you, praying you patiently to give me the hearing, and attentively conſider my talk, and well to note the whole, from the beginning to the End.</p>
                  <p>When I had paſſed in all Folly and Laſtiviouſneſſe three weeks of the years of mine age: that is to ſay, My in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, Child age, and Youth, which make together one and twenty years, I entred into the age of a young man, which is the fourth week of my age, which is between two and twenty and four and twenty years. At five and twenty I was minded to make a Voyage, by my fooliſh induſtry to ſeek where in this World I might ſtud true Felicity and Happineſſe, which ſeemed to my ſortiſh ſenſe an eaſſe matter, being Young, Strong, wild, Hardy, and Couragiouſly diſpoſed.
<pb facs="tcp:102717:6"/>Me thought in my mind, to live in the world without Felicity, was a Life worſe than Death. But alas, being plunged in deep darkneſs of Agnorance, I conſidered not that true Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was the Gift of God from above, and cannot be attained without his help.</p>
                  <p>Being robbed of Reaſon, I thought it might come eaſily of my ſelf without the help of others: ſo that then I ſought true Felicity, where ſhe is not, was not, nor ever ſhall be: as in Riches, worldly Pleaſure, ſtrength, Honour, and Delights of the fleſh. But I was in ſo thinking as very a Fool as he, who hopeth with Angling Lines to catch Fiſhes in the Air, or with Hounds to hunt the Hare in the Ocean Sea: were it not, think you, a great Folly ſo to think? Even the like is it to think that true Felicity is to be found here in this wretched world. And for ſo much as in perfect Felicity is Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all goodneſs, and that the world (as ſaith St. <hi>John</hi>) <hi>Is addicted and given to all Evill, and Subject to hunger, thirſt, heat, cold, diſeaſes, calamities, pride, ambition, covetouſneſs, and voluptuouſneſs;</hi> it is evident that thoſe which here be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſuppoſing here to find true Felicity are worſe then Fools, and void of right Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>True Felicity is not without goodneſs and vertue, which cometh from God above: if it be ſo, why then is it not a moſt wicked and Preſumptuous Opinion, to think that by a Mans own induſtry he is able to poſſeſs and enjoy the fair for of true Felicity? Therefore every one that thinketh, in this world, he may come to perfect Felicity and true bleſſedneſs, ſhall find, in fine, as I found, for Felicity, Vanity; for Good, Evill.</p>

                     <p>The Wandring Knight declareth unto Dame Folly his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, what is his Intent.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>INtending to take my journey, I conſidered that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to uſe Councell therein, knowing that whatſoever is done without advice cannot have good Sucteſs: as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:102717:7"/>a matter diſcreetly attempted is luckily ended. Then dwelt with me a Damoſel which ruled my Houſe, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name was <hi>Folly,</hi> the only Enemy to <hi>Wiſdome:</hi> For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that hateth the one, loveth the other. There is as much difference between them, as between white and black, hot and cold, moiſt and dry, light and darkneſs, God and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: all which be contraries, and cannot be in one body together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wiſdome</hi> governes the good: <hi>Folly</hi> the evill. <hi>Wiſdome</hi> maketh the evill good, when they yield themſelves to be her Subjects: <hi>Folly</hi> maketh the good evill, when they place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under her Protection. <hi>Wiſdome</hi> draweth Men from Hell, and bringeth them to Heaven: <hi>Folly</hi> fetcheth Angels from Heaven to dwell in Hell.</p>
                  <p>I do not term that <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> to know the ſeven Liberal Soiences, the qualities of the Stars and Planets; but I count him wiſe that hath the true knowledge of God. For, as ſaith Saint <hi>Cyrill, Wiſdome is that true underſtanding, by the which the Soveraign good, namely God, is ſeen, known and loved, with a chaſte love and pure Affection. Folly</hi> is very Ignorance, and ſalſe Worſhipping of God. <hi>Wiſdome</hi> maketh Fools wiſe, and <hi>Folly</hi> maketh wiſe Men Fools. Lell me, I pray you, can there be a greater Wiſdome than to ſerve God with a pure Faith, and to obſerve and keep his holy Law Obediently? And contrariwiſe, can there be greater Folly than to commit Sin, and to diſobey God by tranſgreſſing his Commandements? It is not poſſible. For whoſoever committeth ſin, burieth himſelf, and runs head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Hell, which is a point of very great Folly. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all thoſe that ſaithfully ſerve God, and keep his holy Commandements, are wiſe, and governed by <hi>Wiſdome:</hi> and all thoſe that tranſgreſs ſhe Commandements of God are Fools, and foſtered by <hi>Folly,</hi> as Slaves or Vaſſals. When I wandred into wanton wayes, I wrought my will, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf wiſe, but I proved a flat Fool. Thus foſtered by <hi>Folly,</hi> to whom I unfolded my intent, which was to take upon me a Voyage to find Felicity and Meſſedneſs, I reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted her Counſell; who without regard whether it were profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for me or no, did not only like the matter, but alſo
<pb facs="tcp:102717:7"/>forced me forwards, and with flattering phraſe commended my Enterprize. And to encourage me therein, ſhe began to exalt my device, to commend my induſtry and wit, to praiſe my ſtrength, to advance my vertue, to blaze my knowledge, to decipher my beauty, and to extoll all my qualities: ſaping that I was a ſecond <hi>Solomon,</hi> to have in my head ſuch nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cogitations. Hereupon ſhe promiſed to be my Enide, and vowed not to go from me in all my Voyage, affirming that ſhe had ſundry ſeaſons made the like journey, and that I might aſſure my ſelf ſhortly to ſee the Palace of true Felicity.</p>
                  <p>My Son (quoth ſhe) I would not have thee think, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Evil or Guile can have place in my heart. Thus Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or rather emboldened, I thought my ſelf moſt happy to have ſuch a Governeſſe, ſo wiſe, ſo grave, and ſo expert, for very joy whereof my heart tickled within me: But alas, wretch that I was, my deſtre was alwayes after contrary Things: for I rejected whatſoever tended to my Health, in ſo much that to me ſowre ſeemed ſweet, black ſeemed white, evil ſeemed good, <hi>Folly</hi> ſeemed <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> Light ſeemed Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And <hi>Folly</hi> ſo fore bewitched me, that I neglected to do the good I ſhould have done, and I was too willing to play the part I ſhould not have plaved. It is true that the wiſe man make, ſaying: <hi>There is health, where many do give counſell; and he that taketh good advice and counſell before, ſhall not repent him after.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is forbidden to take counſell of Fools. For that they love but what they like. There is an old Proverb, <hi>Such as my Councellour is, ſuch needs muſt be my Counſell:</hi> It were againſt all reaſon, that a Fool ſhould give good Councell: For this is even as if Rivers ſhould run againſt the Hill. Nothing can be compared to good Counſell: neither can any thing be worſe than evil Counſell: by the which the World is troubled, Realms moleſſed, Princes defaced, Kings killed, Empires altered, Townes taken, Cities ſacked, Lawes aboliſhed. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice generally corrupted, Divine Myſteries prophaned, mingled with miſchief, and confounded: the true knowledge of God is forgotten, all Reverence to Superiours neglected: Shame-faſtneſſe, Sobriety, Faith, Hope, Charity, and all other Virtues defaced; all manner of Wars both Forraign and

                     <p>Folly and Evill-will provided the Knight Apparell, Armour, and Horſes.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>FOraſmuch as Men oftentimes do alter their intents, <hi>Folly</hi> was bufie and earneſt to force me forward, in the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my purpoſe, perſwading me to put my ſelf on the way, and ſaying, that ſuch good meanings and enterpriſes ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently and without delay be put in execution, for ſear of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences that might enſue: and that to mean a matter without doing it, was a reproach to any Perſon. Whereto I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I would proceed whatſoever followed thereupon: but me thought it was neceſſary to have company, and other provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Apparell, Horſes, and Armour, ſit for ſuch a Voyage. My Son (quoth ſhe) I will take that charge upon me, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to truſt: caſt all care from Thee, let nothing torment thee, be of good cheer, Sleep at thine eaſe, refuſe no reſt: for I will within few dayes bring thee all neceſſaries that thou ſhalt need; and ſeeing thou haſt ſubmitted thy ſelf to me, I will not ſail thee. Being glad of theſe words, I referred the whole matter to her diſcretion, and took mine eaſe.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Folly</hi> was acquainted with an Armourer, named <hi>Evill-will,</hi> whoſe company ſhe daily frequented. This Armourer was not alwayes occupied in forging Armours, but alſo oftentimes he made Shirts, Hoſen, Doublets, and medled in all matters that his Friend <hi>Folly</hi> appointed him to do.</p>
                  <p>To this Armourer <hi>Folly</hi> declared all my purpoſe, and he at her requeſt made me a Shirt of Laſciviouſneſſe, a Doublet of lewd Deſires, Hoſen of vain Pleaſures, Armour of Ignorance, a Corſlet of Inconſtancy, Vambraces of Arrogancy, Gauntlets of Idleneſs, a Gorget of Licourouſneſs, a Helmet of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, a Buckler of Shameleſneſſe, a quilt Cap of Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, a Girdle of Intemperanee, a Sword of Rebellion, and a Lance, named <hi>Hope of long Life.</hi> Then <hi>Pride</hi> prepared me a galloping Horſe called <hi>Temerity, or Raſhneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:102717:8"/>
                  <p>All theſe wicked weapons, with this prodigal apparel, and unhoneſt Armour, <hi>Evil-will</hi> prepared me at <hi>Follies</hi> requeſt. And what better ſervice can he do, ſeeing he is deprived of truth and verity? for as good will is the worker of all goodneſſe, ſo is evill will of wickedneſſe.

                  <argument>
                     <p>Folly apparelleth, and armeth the wandring Knight.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WHiles <hi>Folly</hi> my Governeſſe, and <hi>Evill-will</hi> my Armou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer prepared my Apparel, and other proviſion, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got not to caſt all care behind me, as <hi>Folly</hi> commanded. For when I was a Child, I did eat alwaies of the beſt meat, drank of the delicateſt drink, I ſlept when I liſted, I lay in ſoft Silk, I paſſed my time in pleaſures, truſting to my Governeſſe <hi>Folly</hi> in all my affairs. After I paſſed three dayes in pleaſure, upon a morning, being in my Golden ſleep, Dame <hi>Folly</hi> came to my Beds ſide, accompanied with <hi>Evil-will,</hi> and with them they brought all my neceſſaries. When ſhe ſaw me aſleep in my ſoft Bed at that time of the day, toſſing my ſelf every way wantonly, ſhe ſaid: what, pretty one, are you yet in Bed: It is late, ariſe. Ah, my ſweet Friend (quoth I) I have followed your advice, I have caſt all care away, and taken mine caſe in mine Inne: but I wonder how you are ſo ſoon returned.</p>
                  <p>What man (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) know not you how diligent I am in mine affairs? I never reſt till all things be brought about, that once I take in hand. Then ſhe put on me my ſhirt of <hi>Laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiouſneſſe,</hi> moſt agreeable to my wanton will, and then all my delight was to be delieately handled, pompouſly Apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſoft Lodged. After that, on went my Doublet, of <hi>Lewd
<pb facs="tcp:102717:9"/>deſires,</hi> aiwaies enemy to the good Spirit: then my Hoſen of <hi>Vaine pleaſures,</hi> tied together with the Points of delight. Then I was full of lewd deſires, I took pleaſure in nothing but vanity; and as my deſires were damnable, ſo were my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Then, as I was making me ready, <hi>Folly</hi> commanded the Clerk of my Kitchin, called <hi>Ill-government,</hi> to prepare me my Breakfaſt, of light and delicate meats, in doing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of my Cook was more cunning, then ever <hi>Cicero</hi> was Eloquent in ſpeaking. And thus as <hi>Folly</hi> and I were merrily diſcourſing together, ſpending time till Breakfaſt, I took occaſton to ask of what age ſhe was, and alſo what jeſts and ſine feats ſhe had, what people ſhe had governed and how ſhe ruled them. She ſaid, that queſtion was asked and anſwered long ago: But as we rid on the way, ſhe would declare all; in the mean time ſhe ſaid that ſhe was about ſive thouſand years old. How can that be (quoth I) you do not ſeem to be forty years old. Yes (quoth ſhe) thou muſt underſtand, that I was born at the preſent hour that the World was made, and have ever ſince ſtood in ſtrength, alwaies in health, and never ſick, I ſhall never ſeem old, though I live till doomes day: Fools die, but <hi>Folly</hi> never dieth. Having ever been in force, I forceably do reign in every corner of the world, and do govern as well Princes as poor People.</p>
                  <p>Now to our purpoſe: after waſhing in ſweet water, in came my breakfaſt, ſo ſumptuous, that Partridges were eſteemed paltry for Pages, Pheſants for common folk. Breakfaſt finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on went mine Armour: but being once apparelled and armed, I cared not for my ſouls health, I had no deſire to bear the Word of God, no fear to follow his Commandements, or to do any thing fit for a Chriſtian towards his ſalvation: I did what I would, I ſaid what I pleaſed. And after that I was covered with my ſteel coat of ignorance, and my corſlet of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, I preſently became inconſtant, and variable, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times altering my intent, not for better but for worſe, out of one ill into another. I never ceaſed to acquaint my ſelf, now with one ſin, and then with another, doing nothing that ſeemed good or honeſt. For ſuch is the nature of ſin, that unleſſe it
<pb facs="tcp:102717:9"/>be ſoon ſubdned, it will draw unto it another ſin, as witneſſeth Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in his firſt Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Folly</hi> put on my Vambraces of Arrogancy, which made me become careleſs and preſumptuous, taking things in hand far paſſing my capacity, ſtrength and ability, and not fearing to adventure on that which was above my reach. But being armed with Arrogancy, up went my curled Haire, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced my ſelf ignorantly above others: then on went my Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get of Gluttony, and Licorouſneſs, the breeders of all fleſhly ſins, and chiefly of Leachery: For when the belly is full of licouriſh meats and drinks, it warmes and heats the other Members exceedingly, which by and by wraſtle and ſtrive againſt the good Spirit: Bu if the belly were bridled from Gluttony, thoſe rebellious Members would be ſubdued, as ſaith the Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Poet: <hi>Sine Cerere &amp; Baccho friget Venus,</hi> That is to ſay:
<q>
                        <l>From Wine and good chear thy belly refrain,</l>
                        <l>And luſt of the fleſh ſmall heat doth contain.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vpon all this <hi>Folly</hi> put me on another Armour, called <hi>Vain-glory,</hi> which is of ſuch a property, that the greater it grew, the leſs I perceived it: then on went my Girdle of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, which did let looſe the Bridle of Leachery, and all other fleſhly affections: to it was tyed my Sword of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: ſo that then I rebelled againſt God, his holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and all Magiſtrates and Superiours. But if I had bridled my boldneſs, reprehending my ſelf, in my deſires and affections, and had reſted in Reaſon without rebelling, then I had ſerved God, and obeyed my betters with all dutifull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. Dame <hi>Folly</hi> diſguiſed me with a Helmet of wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, upon the top whereof was put a Peacocks Tail: ſo that then I might not ſuffer any Check for any Fault, but might and did maintain my Opinion againſt all men, giving place to none whatſoever, Learned, or in Authority. After my Gauntlets of Idleneſs were once on my hands, I greatly gloried of the gifts which were in me, vaunting my ſelf to be more rich, more Wiſe, more Strong, more Hardy, more Gracious, and in all reſpects better then I was. Many times I boaſted
<pb facs="tcp:102717:10"/>of mine imperfections, as of Drunkenneſs, Lechery, and ſuch like. Then on went my Buckler of ſhameleſneſs, which being about my ſhoulders, I bluſhed not to commit any villany, I led the life of an Inſider, rather than a Chriſtian: Vnſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully I deſpiſed both God and Man, nothing regarding mine own honour, renown, or ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Then I mounted on <hi>Temerity</hi> my Horſe, with a Lance in my hand, called Hope of long life. O deceitfull Lance! more rotten then a Reed. How many proper youths have truſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, hoping to have been ſafe and aſſured, and were daily deceived. This Lance once being poſſeſſed by me, I entertained all vices, it ever bindred me from embracing Repentance, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading me in this manner: Thou art young, make merry whiles thou mayeſt, for when thou art old, all play and paſtime will be paſt: then it will be time enough for thee to repent. Being thus governed by <hi>Folly,</hi> I thought neither of God nor the Devill, of Life nor Death, of Heaven nor Hell: but lived at my pleaſure, doing what I delighted in. At laſt <hi>Folly</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled her ſelf lightly with a cloak of Feathers, and mounted upon a Iennet, and opening her Feathers and Wings, with the wind away ſhe flew; and I alſo at a wild adventure ſet the Spurs to my Horſe, and away we went both. Thus you ſee that <hi>Folly</hi> is my Guide, <hi>Temerity</hi> my Horſe. Now the firſt that ſhall repent this Voyage muſt needs be my ſelf, as you may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently judge and gather before hand.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Folly upon the way ſheweth the Wandring Knight many of her ancient proceedings, and how many great and Noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages ſhe had governed.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter we were ſo far paſſed upon our way, that we had leſt the ſight of my Houſe, I called to my remembrance the promiſe which Dame <hi>Folly</hi> had made me in the morning, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſhe would tell me of her exploits paſt, and what People ſhe had governed. And thus with flattering phraſe I began; My good Miſtriſs, my loving Lady, my Heart, my Aoy, my Life,
<pb facs="tcp:102717:10"/>my Luſt, my Counſell, my Hope, my Soveraign good, I deſire thee moſt earneſtly (if it pleaſe thee) to let me underſtand thine ancient proceedings, and to rehearſe what People thou haſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, how they were ruled, lead, conducted, and counſelled.</p>
                  <p>Mine exploits (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) are innumerable. Ten dayes are not enough to repeat halfe of them. Nevertheleſs to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh thy requeſt, and to ſhorten the tediouſneſs of the way, I will tell thee of the meſt Principalleſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the World and I was together, and becauſe I found no Man in the World, I aſcended up into Heaven, and there aſſaulted the excellenteſt Angel of all the whole company, called <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who at my preſent arrivall entertained and received me for his Governeſs, and ſo did many more of his Coequals. By my counſell he advanced himſelf to be fellow mate with God; for the which preſumption both he and his were thruſt out of Heaven, and thrown headlong into Hell. That was the firſt of my exploits.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after, God made Man, and of his rib faſhioned Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, theſe two were Husband and Wife, with them both I had much ado, becauſe they were full of Wiſdome and Reaſon. I u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the help and ſubtilty of a Serpent, to tempt the woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weaker, who with his deceitfull words won her to eat of the Apple which God forbad to be eaten. But after ſhe had eaten it, in the preſence of her Husband (becauſe he feared her ſadneſs) he did eat alſo to fulfill her deſire and luſt: wherein they both committed great folly, for the which they were depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Innocency, of Gods Grace and Glory, yea, they were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the place appointed by God for them to dwell in, and made (with all their poſterity) ſubject to eternall death. This was my ſecond principall exploit.</p>
                  <p>Then began my raign in the World, where I governed a number of Fool<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; I governed <hi>Cain</hi> the firſt born both of his Father and Mother. By my counſell he killed his good brother <hi>Abel</hi> the Innocent. I governed the greated Gyants that ever were of the ſeed of Man, as the Daughters of <hi>Cain,</hi> and the Sons of <hi>Seth:</hi> I made them truſt in their own ſtrength, not only touching fears of war, but I cauſed them alſo to contemne the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ord of God, and the knowledge of the ſame: I perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:102717:11"/>them to uſe their Liberty, and to live according to their Luſt, in Lechery and all other abominations, without regard of the uprightneſs of nature, honeſty, or fear of God.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Noe</hi> had preached forty years ſpace of the laſt deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World, theſe obſtinate Gyants being nuzzeled in all wickedneſs of life, deteſtably turned all his Admonitions and Sermons to mockery: whereat God was wroth, and ſent a great Floud which drowned all living Creatures ſaving <hi>Noe</hi> and his three Sons, <hi>Sem, Ham</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> with their wives. Then I thought to have loſt my raign in world, but in ſhort ſpace they encreaſed wonderfully.</p>
                  <p>Then I counſelled them to build an high Tower, which might reach as high as Heaven, that in deſpight of God they might ſave themſelves, if again be meant to drown the world: But God confounded their device; and where before all the world ſpake in one Language, he divided them, ſo that the Lower remained unfiniſhed, for the Builders underſtood not each others ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>Then the Poſterity of <hi>Noah</hi> were diſperſed throughout the world, and I reigned amongſt them every where, counſelling many Nations to forſake the knowledge of God, and to worſhip the Hoſt of Heaven, as the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Planets, the Fire, the water, the Air, and the Earth, and to make Idols. and honour them in the likeneſſe of Men, of Beaſts, and Birds, and to worſhip them, ſo that the true knowledge of God ſhould be proper but unto one People, deſcended from the loynes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and they are the Iewes.</p>
                  <p>Then I demanded of <hi>Folly,</hi> how Idolatry entred the world, and where ſhe took place firſt. My Son (quoth ſhe) underſtand that Idolatry hath been brought into the world by my means, For Idolatry took her firſt Original and beginning in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> in the City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and in the Region or Country of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> in the raign of <hi>Ninus</hi> the third King, which was the Son of <hi>Bell, Bell</hi> of <hi>Nimroth, Nimroth</hi> of <hi>Chus, Chus</hi> of <hi>Cham, Cham</hi> of <hi>Noe:</hi> ſo that <hi>Ninus</hi> the third King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> was the firſt Man that did ordain Temples, and ſet up Altars, to Sacrifice upon, unto his Father <hi>Bell,</hi> and to <hi>Juno</hi> his Mother. Firſt, he faſhioned their ſtanding I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
<pb facs="tcp:102717:11"/>and ſet them in the middeſt of the City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that was the firſt beginning of Idolatry: other Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Nations did as much: the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> made the like by <hi>Oſiris,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the true Son of <hi>Cham</hi> and of <hi>Rhea.</hi> The ſame <hi>Oſiris,</hi> after his death was eſteemed of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> for his Vertue to be a God, ſo that the matter by my Counſell (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) turned to Idolatry. For they offered Sacrifice unto him, and honoured him in form of an Ox or a Calfe: the like alſo did the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts with their Idol, which afterwards was named <hi>Seraphis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as yet <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> were not infected with Idolatry, howbeit I did my Endeavour to make it more Vniverſall, and ceaſed not, till that ſhortly after this Peſtilence had taken Root. For the above-named <hi>Ninus,</hi> Sonne of <hi>Bell</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> married <hi>Semiramis,</hi> that wonderfull Woman, who (as it is written) deviſed that all the Male Children ſhould be gelded; of her Body begat he one Sonne named <hi>Ninus</hi> the Second, and by another wiſe he had another Sonne called <hi>Trabeta,</hi> who by Right of Succeſſion ſhould have enjoyed the Crown of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but that his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law kept him from it, and took the Government and rule unto her ſelf, and kept it in the behalfe of her young Sonne <hi>Ninus. Trabeta</hi> then fearing his Step-Mother, fled from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and after long travell he arrived in <hi>France,</hi> not farr from the River of <hi>Rhene,</hi> where he founded a City and called it <hi>Treves,</hi> which is yet a very ancient City. At that time was <hi>Gallica Belgica,</hi> and all the Country about it, which we call <hi>Low Almaine,</hi> firſt Infected and Poyſoned with Idolatrry, which was <hi>1947</hi> Years before the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Ieſus Chriſt. There <hi>Trabeta</hi> (by my Counſell) made the Picture of his Grand-father <hi>Bell</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth,</hi> the great Gyant, and firſt <hi>Saturn</hi> of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> to be Worſhipped in the City of <hi>Treves.</hi> But afterward <hi>Bavo</hi> who founded the City <hi>Pelges,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Bayvoy</hi> in <hi>Hainot,</hi> had taken by Force the City of <hi>Treves,</hi> and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly brought to <hi>Bavoy</hi> all the Treaſure of <hi>Treves,</hi> and their Idols, wherewith alſo he brought his own Idols from <hi>Phrygia,</hi> By this means the errour of Idolatry was more
<pb facs="tcp:102717:12"/>authoriſed: For by my counſell he built with the ſpoyles of his conqueſt ſeven marvellous and mighty Temples in his City, which had ſeven doors, according to the ſeven Planets; they had alſo a thouſand Towers, every one an hundred cubits high, and eighteen foot broad. By what I have related, (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) you may perceive that the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> the <hi>Phrygians,</hi> the <hi>French-men,</hi> and the <hi>Germains,</hi> followed my counſell: but as for other Nations, they were not as yet infected with Idolatry: For the good Patriarch <hi>Noah,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Janus,</hi> having dwelt in <hi>Italy</hi> fourſcore and two years, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>950</hi> years old, (<hi>370</hi> years after the Floud) he dyed, before the Incarnation <hi>1976</hi> years. This good Man was lamented and bewayled through all the World generally, but chiefly of the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians,</hi> then called <hi>Lanigenes,</hi> and of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> over whom be firſt raigned. Theſe People preſently after they knew of <hi>Noahs</hi> death, they honoured him as a holy Man: For in thoſe dayes all holy Men were counted Gods: as it is often mentioned in the holy Scripture, <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods;</hi> and <hi>ye all are children of the moſt high.</hi> And which is more, they made him Temples and Altars, as now adayes Idolaters do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Saints of Heaven. I (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) made the ſimple peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aſſure themſelves that his Soul was removed into ſome of the Heavenly bodies, for the which they called him the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the ſeen of the World, the Father of Gods, the greater and leſſer, the God of Peace, Iuſtice, and Holineſſe, the driver a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of evill things, and the preſerver of all good things. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they called his Succeſſours, <hi>Janus, Geminus, Quadifrons, Enotrius, Ogiges, Vertumnus, Jupiter Optimus Maximus.</hi> Then I perſwaded the People to offer Sacrifice unto him as unto God, by which deed they became all Idolaters: for if they had eſteemed him no better then a holy Man, they had not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that, for indeed he was a holy Man. Mark what <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſaith in his tenth Book of the City of God: <hi>It is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to offer any ſacrifice to any Saint be it Man or Angel, but only to God.</hi> After the deſtruction of <hi>Troy, Aeneas</hi> came into <hi>Italy,</hi> bringing with him his own Idols, and the Gods of <hi>Troy:</hi> hereupon Idolatry took force, and encreaſed more and more. I think (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) that this which I
<pb facs="tcp:102717:12"/>have told thee already may ſuffice to declare how Idolatry en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the world firſt. Thou beſt heard alſo how I governed Angels and Nations. Now thou ſhalt underſtand how I have ruled and ordered particular perſons.</p>
                  <p>After the Floud, I firſt ruled <hi>Cham, Noahs</hi> Son, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly given to the Magicall Art, obtained, and had the name of <hi>Zoroaſter.</hi> He hated his Father, becauſe he loved his own brother better then him, in revenge whereof upon a day he found his Father <hi>Noah</hi> drunk, lying faſt aſleep upon the ground, unhoneſtly he diſcovered his Fathers Privities: and (by my counſell) he preſumed to touch thoſe his ſecret parts, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted them by his Magicall Art, ſo that ever after for want of ability, he could not joyne iſſue with any woman to beget Children. His Father being angry thereat, abandoned him for a ſeaſon. After that, he became the firſt King and <hi>Saturn</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> inſomuch as the holy Scriptures called <hi>Cham</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, by my counſell he trayned up his People according to his own Nature, in all villany and filthineſs; openly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Men might lawfully uſe and have to do with their own Daughters and Siſters, as was the cuſtome before the Floud, and alſo to commit many other unlawfull deeds, which I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to declare: by the which doctrine, natural Virginity was oftentimes violently aſſaulted and raviſhed. Then my friend <hi>Cham</hi> went into <hi>Italy</hi> and Vſurped the Realm to himſelf. And whereas other Princes of his Linage in <hi>Germany, Spain,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> gave good examples to their Subjects, inſtructing them in good and godly Lawes, he contrariwiſe ſpoyled all the Youths in <hi>Italy,</hi> corrupting them with all kinds of Vices, as Leachery, Theft, Mutther, Poyſoning, and Enchantment, whereof he himſelf was the firſt Inventer, as all Hiſtoriographers hold O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. But when his good Father <hi>Noah</hi> underſtood of it, he came into <hi>Italy,</hi> and hunted him from thence.</p>
                  <p>If I ſhould write of all the evill deeds of <hi>Cham,</hi> it would be a weighty piece of work, and the matter would ſeem monſtrous. But at the laſt, he conveyed himſelf over among the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> a People inhabiting towards the <hi>Indians,</hi> where by his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment the People became his Subjects, and he raigned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:102717:13"/>them with great Force and Power. Yet at the laſt he was Vanquiſhed and Slain in Battel by <hi>Ninus</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which deſcended of his race by his Son <hi>Chus.</hi> Thus (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) I loſt my Friend <hi>Cham,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Zoroaſter, Saturn</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the common Enemy of God and Man, and one of the moſt perverſe and untowardeſt Tyrants that ever was in the World.</p>
                  <p>I governed <hi>Bell</hi> the ſecond Ring of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and his Sonne <hi>Ninus:</hi> into wheſe heads. I put a diſordinate raging, ſo that they deſired to rule alone in the World. And to bring this to paſs, I counſelled them to change and cut off the Golden Age, which would have things common, peaceable, and in quiet. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they armed themſelves by all poſſible means, undertaking to ſpoyle <hi>Sebatius Saga,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Saturn,</hi> King and Patriarch of <hi>Armenia,</hi> ſo made and ordained by his Grand-Father <hi>Noah.</hi> The ſame <hi>Sebatius</hi> was Son of <hi>Chus,</hi> and Brother to <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth,</hi> whom <hi>Moſes</hi> called <hi>Sabtah</hi> in Hebrew, which in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine is <hi>Saturnus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the ſaid <hi>Sebatius</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> (having hardly eſcaped the hands of <hi>Bell</hi> and <hi>Ninus</hi>) went for refuge to his Brand-father <hi>Noah</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> where <hi>Noah</hi> made him King and Patriarch of the <hi>Aborignes,</hi> and founded him a City on the other ſide of <hi>Tiber,</hi> which was named <hi>Saturnia:</hi> as <hi>Virgill</hi> declareth in a paſſage, where he ſaith thus:
<q>
                        <l>Primus ab æthereo venit Saturnus Olympo,</l>
                        <l>Arma Jovis ſugiens, &amp; regnis exul ademptis.</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>That is to ſay:</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Saturn the firſt, from's Realm did flie,</l>
                        <l>for fear of Joves Artillery,</l>
                        <l>He loſt his Rule and Regiment,</l>
                        <l>and led his life in baniſhment.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Bell</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Nimroth</hi> was ſirnamed <hi>Jupiter.</hi> And it is not likely to be true, as ſome ſay, that the ſame <hi>Saturn</hi> that was chaſed away by <hi>Jupiter</hi> was <hi>Nimroth</hi> the King of <hi>Crete;</hi> but the Bible ſaith, that he was King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> which was far diſtant from the Iſle of <hi>Crete.</hi> In thoſe dayes they termed the chief Man of every Houſe <hi>Saturn:</hi> their Sons <hi>Jupiters</hi> or <hi>Joves:</hi> their Daughters, <hi>Juno's:</hi> and their
<pb facs="tcp:102717:13"/>Nephewes, <hi>Hercules:</hi> ſo that we find in ancient Records, many men named <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Hercules.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to my purpoſe, (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) the above named <hi>Ninus</hi> by my counſell, after the death of his Father <hi>Bell,</hi> cauſed his Picture and ſtanding Image to be made, commanding every man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſon to do Homage unto the Idols of his Father and Mother, and to adore them with Divine Worſhip: and ſo be was (as you have heard) the firſt Inventer of Idolatry. I governed <hi>Tiphon</hi> the Son of <hi>Cham,</hi> in whom all his Fathers Vices abounded. He maliciouſly envyed the proſperity of his Brother <hi>Oſiris,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Jupiter the juſt,</hi> who was a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuter of Tyrants. It angred me (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) that ſo honeſt a man lived. Then I cauſed <hi>Tiphon</hi> with other Gyants, to murther <hi>Oſiris,</hi> inſomuch that <hi>Tiphon</hi> out him in ſix and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pieces, and beſtowed them upon other Gyants that helped him to work his feat. But the good <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Lybia,</hi> the Son of <hi>Oſiris,</hi> with the help of his other Brethren, in foughten Field, killed <hi>Tiphon</hi> the Gyant, and the other Tyrants which conſented to his Fathers death.</p>
                  <p>I governed (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) one <hi>Jupiter</hi> King of <hi>Crete,</hi> which Country is now called <hi>Candie.</hi> But foraſmuch as the Greek Lyars, and other Writers both Latine and French, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their Lyes and Dreams, attribute that unto this <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> oftentimes, which appertains not to him, I would have you mark well, that in thoſe dayes, the Kings Children and Fathers of Families, were called <hi>Jupiters</hi> or <hi>Joves:</hi> notwithſtanding there are three of that name renowned, as we find in Hiſtories. The firſt was <hi>Oſiris</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cham:</hi> who was no leſs good then his Father was evill. This <hi>Jupiter</hi> begat great <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Lybia:</hi> who was King of <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> This great <hi>Hercules</hi> was like unto his Father, a great perſecuter of Tyrants throughout all the world. He begat of <hi>Araxa,</hi> the young <hi>Tuſcus,</hi> King of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Tuſcus</hi> begat <hi>Alcirus Blaſcon,</hi> by whom was begotten <hi>Cambo Blaſcon,</hi> which was (as ſome ſay) ſirnamed the ſecond <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and worſhipped in the world. Now this <hi>Cambo Blaſcon</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Jupiter,</hi> begat upon <hi>Electra</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Arlas</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:102717:14"/>ſirnamed <hi>Italus</hi> (of whom yet <hi>Italy</hi> beareth the name) <hi>Jaſius</hi> and <hi>Dardanus.</hi> This the lying <hi>Cretians,</hi> and many other Triflers, attribute unto <hi>Jupiter</hi> of <hi>Crete:</hi> which matter is in controverſie and may be denyed. For <hi>Dardanus</hi> after he had killed his Brother <hi>Jaſius</hi> by envy and treaſon, he fled into the Iſle of <hi>Samos,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Phrygia,</hi> where he foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a City called <hi>Dardania,</hi> where he begat a Sen called <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rictonius,</hi> and of him lineally deſcended <hi>Troas</hi> who gave the City of <hi>Dardania</hi> the name of <hi>Troy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſame <hi>Troas</hi> had three children, <hi>Illius, Iſſaracula,</hi> and <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> which <hi>Ganimedes</hi> was taken by <hi>Tatus</hi> the King of high <hi>Phrygia</hi> and ſold to <hi>Jupiter</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> to be abuſed like a Sodomite: which argueth that he begat not <hi>Dardanus</hi> the great Grand-father of <hi>Ganimedes.</hi> The firſt <hi>Jupiter</hi> then you may perceive was <hi>Oſiris,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Noah,</hi> whom <hi>Moſes</hi> named <hi>Mazaraim.</hi> The ſecond <hi>Jupiter</hi> was <hi>Cambo Blaſcon</hi> King of <hi>Italy,</hi> which ſome ſay alſo had been King of <hi>Athens,</hi> and of <hi>Arcady,</hi> but I think that <hi>Jupiter</hi> of <hi>Arcady,</hi> who begat <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon,</hi> is ſome other beſide <hi>Cambo Blaſcon.</hi> Howſoever the caſe ſtandeth, certain it is that <hi>Jupiter</hi> of <hi>Crete, Oſiris</hi> and <hi>Cambo Blaſcon</hi> were contraries.</p>
                  <p>The third <hi>Jupiter,</hi> renowned in the World, was King of the Iſle of <hi>Crete:</hi> who bare in his Seutchion and Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour an Eagle: but in all his manners he was altogether gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Folly.</hi> For he defloured Virgins, he raviſhed Wives, abuſed young children, and committed all kind of Villany that was poſſible either to be ſpoken or done. He committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with <hi>Alcmena,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Amphitrio,</hi> of whom he begat little <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Greece:</hi> he did the like with <hi>Læda</hi> the Wife of <hi>Tyndarus,</hi> of whom alſo he begat fair <hi>Helen:</hi> I loathe to tell what Deflourings and Rapes he offered and thruſt upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his vile life (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) by my means the rude People made him a God, and many falſe Lyars have attributed unto him the Noble deeds of the good Patriarch <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Nephew <hi>Oſiris,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Jupiter the Juſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, they did not only make Sacrifice unto him, but alſo gave him the Title and Name of <hi>Moſt excellent good,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:102717:14"/>whereas indeed he was the werſt evil: for he was an Inceſtuous and Sodomitical perſon, and a common Enemy to Chaſtity and honeſty; in ſo much that People openly in their Stage playes counterfeited, Sung and Deſcanted upon the filthy Leacheries, and other Villanies which he uſed, affirming that ſuch Antiques and Pageants were moſt fit and agreeable unto him: By means whereof all his Subjects gave themſelves to the ſame, ſaying, that it was as fit for them ſo to live, as for their great God <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I governed little <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus,</hi> the Baſtard Son unto the ſame <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whom he had by <hi>Alcmena,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Amphitrio.</hi> Vnto the ſame <hi>Hercules</hi> the lying Greeks, full of Vain Eloquence, give the name and title of great <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Lybia,</hi> which is moſt falſs: For that <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> was the firſt Pyrate that ever roved on the Seas, and abounded with all Vice, following the ſteps of his Father <hi>Jupiter</hi> the Adulterer, in all reſpects; and as he lived, even ſo be dyed: For being mad (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) he ſtew his wife and children, and afterwards burned himſelf. But a little before his death be made <hi>Philactetes</hi> ſwear that he would never diſcloſe his Death, nor the manner how he had beſtowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which thing he did of a Vain, arrogant, proud, and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious mind, even to this end, that the people might report and believe, that the Gods had drawn him up to Heaven inviſtble: but it chanced not as he deſired. Yet notwithſtanding (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) I perſwaded the lying <hi>Greeks</hi> that it was ſo, and made them worſhip him as a God.</p>
                  <p>I governed fair <hi>Paris</hi> King <hi>Priams</hi> Son, whoſe ſirname was <hi>Alexander.</hi> At the firſt he made no account of me, but leading a Contemplative life be followed the Lore of <hi>Pallas</hi> the Goddeſs of wiſdome, mine Adverſary: but when <hi>Juno, Pallas,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> were at ſtrife for the golden Ball, which was thrown amongſt them, (with condition that the faireſt of them ſhould have it) they committed the matter to the Iudgement of <hi>Paris</hi> firnamed <hi>Alexander?</hi> who was upon point ſo give Sentence in the Behalfe of <hi>Pallas</hi> mine Enemy, but by my perſwaſſon afterwards he gave it unto <hi>Venus</hi> my good friend, and my old acquaintance: then for Recompence of his
<pb facs="tcp:102717:15"/>fooliſh judgment, I counſelled him to go to <hi>Greece,</hi> where he raviſhed fair <hi>Helen.</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Greeks</hi> in a great and mad rage prepared all their force againſt the <hi>Trojans,</hi> and after ten years Siege againſt their City they took <hi>Ilion,</hi> and put King <hi>Priam</hi> to death, inſomuch that the whole Realme was thereby defaced.</p>
                  <p>In that War were killed many Princes and Noble Knights, as <hi>Hector, Achilles,</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> alſo was ſlain by <hi>Philactetes</hi> the Companion of the leſſe <hi>Hercules,</hi> in a Combat fought hand to hand. The weapons which they uſed were Bowes and forked Arrowes, wherewith <hi>Philactetes</hi> wounded <hi>Paris</hi> in three places. Firſt, in his left hand; ſecondly, in his right eye; thirdly, in beth his legs, which were faſtned with the ſtroak together. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus wounded, the <hi>Trojans</hi> carried him into the City, where ſhortly after he died.</p>
                  <p>I governed (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) fair <hi>Helen,</hi> the baſtard Daughter of the third <hi>Jupiter</hi> King of <hi>Crete,</hi> begotten of Læda the Wife of <hi>Tindarus:</hi> which <hi>Helen,</hi> by my counſell, went from her Husband <hi>Menelaus,</hi> and ſuffered her ſelf to be raviſhed by a young Lecherous <hi>Trojan</hi> named <hi>Paris,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Son of King <hi>Priam:</hi> ſhe brought blood and death to <hi>Troy,</hi> inſtead of Dowrie: for by her occaſion <hi>Troy</hi> was deſtroyed, and <hi>Priam</hi> with the moſt part of his Children killed. And to the end that her adulterous Mate <hi>Paris</hi> or <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſhould not leave her and go to his own lawful Wiſe <hi>Pagales Oenone,</hi> ſhe bewitched him with certain drinks, wherein ſhe was her crafts Miſtreſſe: which thing when one doth uſe, he is in ſuch caſe that he forgets all things paſt, and all ſorrows preſent. When ſhe was thus arrived at <hi>Troy,</hi> the good man her Husband <hi>Menelaus,</hi> with <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> and other Greek Embaſſadours, came to fetch her away, and King <hi>Priamus</hi> commanded that ſhe ſhould be brought into his preſence, offering unto her frankly with loud boyce, that ſhe ſhould (if ſhe thought good) freely and with full liberty depart again into <hi>Greece,</hi> with all her retinue, people, and pelfe. Whereunto ſhe anſwered in the hearing of her Husband and King <hi>Priam,</hi> with the reſt of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and Commons, that ſhe was not diſpoſed to retire to her Countrey, wiſhing alſo that her Husband <hi>Menelaus</hi> that good
<pb facs="tcp:102717:15"/>man might go to God, that ſhe was none of his wife, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would ſhe have to do with him, and that ſhe came not to <hi>Troy</hi> againſt her will, neither did ſhe eſteem of his marriage.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, at length <hi>Troy</hi> by Treaſon was taken, and ranſackt: eighteen years after ſhe had been from her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and all that ſpace had lived in Leachery, with two Adulterers, ſhe grew to agreement and made peace with her Hasband <hi>Menelaus.</hi> But when ſhe was waxed old ſhe looked in a glaſſe, and ſeeing her lace far from fair, ſhe fell into a loud laughter, and flouted at the Fools that fought ten years together, for the love of a thing that faded ſo ſoon away: but when her Husband <hi>Menelaus</hi> was dead, two chief men of the City <hi>Sparta,</hi> named <hi>Nicoſtratus</hi> and <hi>Magapentus,</hi> men of great authority, hunted <hi>Helen</hi> out of the Citie and Realm of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> without appointing unto her any place or proviſion to keep her. Vpon which Baniſhment ſhe came to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> to her ancient Companion and Friend Queen <hi>Polipo,</hi> which was alſo then a Widow, by reaſon of the Death of her Husband <hi>Tlepolemus,</hi> who was ſtain before <hi>Troy:</hi> And when ſhe was at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> Queen <hi>Polipo</hi> uſed her very well; but the young Gentlewomen her wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maids hated her deadly, for that ſhe was the cauſe that their King <hi>Tlepolemus</hi> was killed: inſomuch that upon a day they conſpired together againſt her, and got her into a Garden, where they faſtning a Rope about her Neck hung her upon a Tree and ſtrangled her to death. This was the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable end of <hi>Helen,</hi> who being dead (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) I put into the heads of the blinde people that ſhe was a Goddeſſe, by reaſon of her incomparable Beauty. For which conſideration they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only Idolatrouſty, and heretically, but alſo damnably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, built her a marvellous coſtly and ſtately Temple, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her with great Devotion, <hi>The Goddeſs of Beauty,</hi> and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many falſe Miracles and Lyes, the which for brevity I let paſs. I governed (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) <hi>Pharaoh Amenophis,</hi> and <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh Bacchoris,</hi> both Kings of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> who by my counſell cauſed all the Male Children of the Iewes to be drowned, which people the firſt <hi>Pharaoh</hi> held in marvellous ſubjection. As for the
<pb facs="tcp:102717:16"/>ſecond, I inſtructed him ſo well that he would not ſuffer ſhe Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to depart out of his Land, but in the end being ſcourged by God he was conſtrained to let them go, and when they were gone, I gave him Counſell, in revenge, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue them with all their Chivalry and Power of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which thing he did: but the Tyrant and all his Company were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the red ſea. I governed <hi>Chore, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> counſelling them not to obey the commandment of <hi>Moſes</hi> whom God had ordained chief Governour over the Children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> but <hi>Chore</hi> in offering Incenſe contrary to his Office, was attainted, and five hundred more of his Faction with him. And for the Rebellion of <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> the Earth opened, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that they, their Wives, children, and goods, were all ſwallowed up alive.</p>
                  <p>I governed <hi>Saul</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> at the beginning of his Reign he was good and Godly, but at laſt I enchanted him ſo that he cauſed many of Gods Prieſts to be killed, inſomuch that in one day he put to Death fourſcore and five. I counſelled him to perſecute good <hi>David,</hi> and to ask counſell of witches and Sorcerers, contrary to Gods Laws; then at the laſt being ſorſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God, he was vanquiſhed by the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and with his own hands ſtew himſelf upon the Mount of <hi>Gilboa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was ſo hold as to enter into King <hi>Davids</hi> Houſe, and by my counſell I made him commit adultery with <hi>Bathſheba</hi> the wife of <hi>Urias:</hi> And notwithſtanding that <hi>Urias</hi> was his faithfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, and good Counſellour, yet I gave him counſell to kill <hi>Urias,</hi> by means whereof his Sin might be covered in marriage of his wife. For the which offence the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> diſcloſed me, ſo that my further meaning brake off, and ever after I was baniſhed his houſe. I alſo governed his Son <hi>Abſolon,</hi> who after he had killed his Brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> made war with his Father, and drabe him from <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> being nothing aſhamed to enter the houſe of all his Fathers concubines, and to lye with them; but an Oak did execute Iuſtice upon that wicked child, for when he thought to eſcape with his Mule, the Tree caught him faſt by the Hair of the head, till <hi>Joab</hi> came with a Dart and killed him.</p>
                  <p>I alſo governed <hi>Rehoboam</hi> King <hi>Solomons</hi> Son, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably grieved and oppreſſed his people with Taxes, and
<pb facs="tcp:102717:16"/>Impoſts: Inſomuch, that when they requeſted to have it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what eaſed, he did not only deny their Petitions, but alſo gave them uncourteous Language, following the counſell of his young wanton Gentelmen, rather then the wiſe admonitions of grave Counſellours, by the which means he loſt the greateſt part of his Realm.</p>
                  <p>I governed the great Queen <hi>Jezabel,</hi> by whoſe advice King <hi>Achab</hi> her Hushand worſhipped the Idol <hi>Baal,</hi> and cauſed good <hi>Naboth</hi> to be killed: She perſecuted the Prophets of God, and made many of them to be put to Death: She ſought by all means to diſpatch good <hi>Elias;</hi> but as her Life was evill, ſo was her death ſhamefull: for ſhe falling from a high window, was ovethrown with horſes feet, and eaten up of Dogs.</p>
                  <p>I governed <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> the laſt King of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> who regarded not the Government of the Realm, but lived alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in delight. He uſed to paint his Face, and to apparell himſelf in womans apparell: he exerciſed himſelf in all kinds of villany and filthineſs: inſomuch that when he ſaw that he was forſaken of the greateſt of his people, and that he had very evill luck in Battell againſt his Enemies, and ſtood upon no ground free from danger of death; It chanced one day, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Tower of <hi>Babylon,</hi> he ſet it on fire, and there burned himſelf, and all that ever he had.</p>
                  <p>I governed <hi>Cambiſes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Son of good King <hi>Gyrus,</hi> who by my counſell was given to gluttony, and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, with other vices not beſeeming a Prince. Vpon a time, <hi>Praxaſpes</hi> one of the moſt excellent counſellours, ſeeing him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately bivving, reverently told him that it was not Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: whereat the King was wroth, and commanded him to ſend for his youngeſt Son, who being brought, <hi>Cambiſes</hi> cauſed <hi>Prax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſpes</hi> to tie him to a Tree, ſaying: <hi>If I can hit the heart of thy Son with an arrow out of my long bow, is it the feat of a man that is drunk?</hi> So <hi>Cambiſes</hi> ſhor, and clobe the childs heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, and ſhewed it unto his Father, with a warning to take heed how he judged his Liege Lord drunk. Then I made him marry his own natural Siſter, and to kill his own Brother. It fortuned upon a day, that as the King and the Queen his ſiſter were at the Table, for his Paſtime and Recreation ſake he had
<pb facs="tcp:102717:17"/>a young Lyon let looſe, and a mighty maſtiffe or Band-Dogge that the King kept: theſe two fought ſo long, till at laſt the Dog was like to have the worſt. Within the ſight of this Game another Maſtiffe was tyed in a Chain, both bred of one Bitch, this band-dog brake his Chain in haſte and came to help his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, inſomuch that theſe two dogs overcame and killed the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The King liked well of the love and loyalty of the two dogs. but the Queen being moved thereat, began to weep bitterly. Which when <hi>Cambiſes</hi> ſaw, he asked the cauſe of her ſorrow, to whoſe demand the Queen anſwered in this ſort:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is otherwiſe happened to my brother, than to this Dog that was too weak for the Lyon. For thou being his own bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, haſt not ſhewed the like love and faithfulneſs unto him, as this Band-dogge hath done to his Mate; for thou haſt cauſed thy brother to be ſlain.</hi> The King being fore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, and full of indignation at her anſwer, commanded that the Queen ſhould be had away by and by out of his ſight, and put to death, the which was done: but as the King came one day out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> riding on horſe-back his Sword by hap fell out of the ſcabbard, and he fell likewiſe upon the point of it, and was thriſt thorow the body, and dyed.</p>
                  <p>I governed (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) one <hi>Cataline</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> a very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Fellow, who conſpired to kill all the Senators of <hi>Rome:</hi> but he was put beſſdes his purpoſe, by reaſon that one <hi>Cicero</hi> opened it, and he, with all his Conſpirators were killed in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. I governed (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) <hi>Horod,</hi> and <hi>Herodias,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their Leachery I coupled them in marriage, albeit ſhe was his Brother <hi>Philips</hi> Wife, which unlawfull marriage Saint <hi>John</hi> reprehending and finding fault withall, for ſo doing had his Head cut off. I governed <hi>Pilate, Annas,</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with many Doctors, Prieſts, Scribes, and Phariſees: I counſelled them to crucifie Chriſt herween two Thieves as if he had been a ſower of Sedition: which being done, I thought then that I had won all the World, but when I ſaw that upon the third day after he roſe again, contrary to my reckoning I loſt a great number of Clyants and Subjects, who hearing the Apoſles preach, quite abandoned and gave me over.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:102717:17"/>
                  <p>I governed <hi>Nero</hi> the firth Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> who at the beginning of his Reign was good and vertuous, but after he had poſſeſſed the Empire five years, he became moſt evill and wicked, and was given to Leachery and Filthineſs. This man was a Murtherer, he flew his Wife, his Mother, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honeſt Perſons, of which number <hi>Seneca</hi> was one; he was the firſt Perſecuter of the Chriſtians, and put many good men to death, as for Example. S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> with other, But the Tyrant being upon a time unguarded, and wanting about him his Lievtenants and Captains of War, the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and States of <hi>Rome</hi> ſought means to puniſh him, for anger whereof he killed himſelf, and the Souldiers that were ſent to ſeek him found him dead in the Field.</p>
                  <p>I governed <hi>Antonine Baſſian Caracalla,</hi> the nineteenth Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome,</hi> who by my counſell killed his brother <hi>Geta:</hi> beſides that, he marryed his Step-mother, and deſired <hi>Pompi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> the great Lawyer to excuſe his murther. Who anſwered him: <hi>That he was not ſo willing to excuſe a Murther as he was to diſcloſe him:</hi> the Emperour unworthy of ſo good an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, killed the Lawyer.</p>
                  <p>I governed <hi>Varius Heliogabalus,</hi> the one and twentieth Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome,</hi> who by my Counſell lived ſo diſſolutely, that he left behind him no memory of honeſt life, but infamy. This Mans own Souldiers ſlew him, and threw him into a ditch; and becauſe his body would not ſink to the bottom, they drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him out again with a Hook, and hurled him into the River <hi>Tiber.</hi> I governed (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) <hi>Julian Apoſtata,</hi> the nine and thirtieth Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> who in his life was ſo wiſe and well given, that he was made Reader in the Church of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemia.</hi> This man Travelled to <hi>Athens,</hi> where he ſtudied Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, but he ſtayed not long in that good purpoſe, for by the connſell of me <hi>Folly,</hi> he renounced the Chriſtian Faith, and became a Revolter, and an Idolater: I perſwaded him to perſecute the Chriſtians, leſt they ſhould encreaſe ſeven for one. I moved him alſo by my ſubtill device, to root and weed them out quite, which thing he meant to do, but he was kild within two years after, who being ſtain in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and yielding up his evill Spirit, he lifted up his bloody hand to
<pb facs="tcp:102717:18"/>Heaven in contempt and deſpight of Ieſus Chriſt, making this out-cry; <hi>Now, O Galilean, thou haſt the Victory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I governed the falſe Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and counſelled him to make a Book, to entitle it <hi>Alcaron,</hi> and to expound things in the holy Scriptures carnally, which he did; and that Law is yet continued in the greateſt part of the World. I Governed <hi>Meſaline</hi> an Empreſs, the Nobleſt Whore in the world, who being but newly marryed to <hi>Claudius</hi> fifth Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> an old Gentleman, when ſhe found by proof, that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was inſufficient, and unable to ſatisfie her leacherous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, by my counſell oftentimes ſhe diſguiſed her ſelf into mans Apparell, and went to the common Stewes, where ſhe abuſed her body with a great number, returning back no better than a Bitch, and vaunted that ſhe had vanquiſhed and gone beyond all the whores in the houſe of Bawdry. When the wandring Knight had heard theſe wonderfull Diſcourſes uttered by <hi>Folly,</hi> and having in him ſome ſparks or Reaſon and inclination of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he thought himſelf fooliſh, if it were not in him to judge of Deeds ſo miſchive ous and ill. And being no longer able to keep ſilence, he breaks his minde to <hi>Folly,</hi> finding great fault with this unfatiable Empreſs; inſomuch that he cryed out with a loud voice, and ſaid, <hi>Fie, fie, fie, filthy Bitch, and Vile Whore, worthy to be tyed to a tree ſtark naked, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to greedy Dogs and ravening Birds to be devoured.</hi> Then I asked <hi>Folly</hi> what was the end of this wicked woman, who told me that the Emperour put her to Death, becauſe ſhe was not content with her lawfull Husband, but marryed another Man, whoſe name was <hi>Silius:</hi> whereunto I aſſented, ſaying, that it was a good deed; for there need no more but three ſuch deteſtable filths in all <hi>France</hi> to ſpoyle the whole Realm.</p>
                  <p>This Tale of <hi>Folly</hi> touching her deeds and exploits, her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and practices, her provocations and counſells, it being long and ſtrange, I am not able to repeat as it was ſpoken: but have nakedly recorded ſo much as reſteth in my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; which thing I have the rather dane, to the end that all devout Chriſtian Readers might willingly learn, and throughly know what great wickedneſs they commit in following the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Counſell of Dame <hi>Folly.</hi> Every one ought to forſake
<pb facs="tcp:102717:18"/>her; for that the end of ſuch as he ruled by her precepts, tread in her paths, and dance after her Pipe, is proved by experience to be dangerous, deadly, and damnable. But noto let us return to our Voyage, and former matter.</p>

In the end we came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtraight, where we found two wayes; one lay on the left hand, was fair, broad, and entring into a goodly green Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; the other, on the right hand, which was narrow, racky, and full of Mountains. Being then in a perplexity, and deubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full which of theſe wayes I might take, <hi>Folly</hi> told me, that the way on the left hand was beſt and faireſt, and <hi>Temerity</hi> my Horſe kept a ſlinging to go that way, ſo that I had much ado to rein him in. Then ſaid I to <hi>Folly,</hi> that I feared leſt the green graſſie way would lead me into ſome ditch and Quagmire, where we ſhould ſtick faſt. Beſtdes that, I was more than halſe diſcouraged with her Tales which ſhe had told me; and though I in heart hated them, yet notwithſtanding cuſtome cauſed me to uſe them, not being able to do otherwiſe without <hi>Gods grace.</hi> Hereupon I was reſolved to take the way on the left hand, <hi>Folly</hi> keeping me company.</p>
                  <p>But as we were thus talking together, I eſpyed two Ladies coming towards the place where we ſtood, (which made me very glad) one of the Ladies rode upon a white Horſe, and went in a Gown of coſtly colours, bravely embroydered with Needle-work, and in a border the three Divine, and the four Morall Vertues were wrought. This Lady was very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and ſhe ſeemed naturally to be fraught with goodly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and gifts; ſhe had a neat body, a ſweet countenance, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt geſture; her face was not painted, ſhe was alwayes very
<pb facs="tcp:102717:19"/>courteous, ſhe pretended authority and Reverence, without flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; ſhe was not ſowre and grim, but lovely and amiable; the other Lady rode upon a Rats coloured Horſe, and went in a changeable coloured Gown, garniſhed with Gold and exceſſive coſt: ſhe wore about her neck a chain of Gold, with rich Iewels tyed unto it: her ſingers were decked with Ring upon Ring: ſhe ſeemed to have been delicately brought up, her Face was beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, but I ſuſpected ſhe was painted: her looks were wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and unconſtant, and ſhe rolled her eyes every way. This Lady came to me before the other, and after Salutations, I asked her which of the two wayes I ſhould take to find per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect Felicity. She anſwered me, ſaying: My Son, if thou wilt follow me, I will bring thee a ſhort and pleaſant way thorow a green Meadow: be not doubtfull; for I will lodge thee this night in the Pallace of <hi>Felicity,</hi> into the which when thou art entred and placed, thou needeſt not think upon any thing, but what may beſt pleaſe thy mind, and procure thy delight: as fine. Fare, Dancing, Singing, ſoft Lodging, Ladies Love, Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Hunting, Hawking, Fiſhing, Fowling, Riding, Running, Shooting, Bowling, Rich Aray, and all things elſe that can be deviſed to pleaſe thy Phantaſie: all which pleaſures I will provide thee, with a thouſand more, for it is in me to beſtow ſuch things upon them that take me for their Miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>With theſe words I was bewitched and longed to ſee this pleaſant Pallace, not miſtruſting that ſhe was any other then ſhe ſaid and ſeemed to be. And being deſtrous to learn her name, I began thus, My good Lady, may it not offend you if I ask your name? My Son (quoth ſhe) ſuch as follow me, and have had experience of my goodneſs, call me <hi>Felicity,</hi> and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerbedly and of good right: For I am indeed the Empreſs of the Pallace of worldly Pleaſures, whither I will bring thee before night, if thou wilt follow me. There be ſome Enemies of mine that nick-name me, and ſpightfully miſ-call me, by falſe and counterfeit terms, ſaying, that I am named <hi>Malice, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Vice,</hi> and <hi>Voluptuouſneſs:</hi> But give thou no ear unto them, for they ſpeak upon envy, hatred, and evill-will.</p>
                  <p>Then approached the other Lady, which, after ſalutation done, uttered theſe words unto me. Reaſon required, that I ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:102717:19"/>have ſpoken firſt, but this painted Peacock, named <hi>Wicked Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs,</hi> puts forth her ſelf for to ſpeak before me alwayes, and to take the Tale out of my mouth. Take heed of her, for doubtleſs her Communication corrupteth and infecteth even the very beſt livers, with the poyſon of her errour. Now I ſee thou art of good Inclination, and ready to weigh thy pathes in the vallance, willing to walk as well the good way as the bad. And ſeeing thy minde wavoureth, apply thy ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Vertue</hi> continually, ſhorten the ſorrow of thy Soul, water thee well with wiſdome, adventure not thy preſent precious age, to be boldned in Ambition and Vain-glory, Deteſt the danger of unſatiable Covetauſneſs; let not thy liking be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on licentious love, avoid and ſhake off Idleneſs, by uſing thy ſelf to honeſt exerciſes, flie <hi>Worldly Felicity,</hi> arm thy ſelf againſt the dart of <hi>Cupid,</hi> leſt at length he overcame thee, open thine ears of underſtanding and follow my Counſell. I am not the vile, villanous, vain, miſchievous, ſubtill, deceitfull, and lying Lady <hi>Voluptuouſneſs;</hi> but I am the aſſured and ſefe way that leadeth to perfect <hi>Felicity.</hi> And though I am narrow and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to paſs, yet if thou wilt follow me, I will make thee merry, and guide thee in the very way which God hath ordained to lead unto true Bleſſedneſs. For, my Son, thou muſt underſtand this, that Almighty God doth not beſtow on Men perfect joy and Soveraign goodneſs, unleſs they labour to archieve it. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou think alwayes to paſs thy time in pleaſure, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thine affection, doing all whatſoever ſeemeth delectable to thy fooliſh fantaſte, and ſuppoſeſt that way to find <hi>Felicity,</hi> thou art farr wide and greatly abuſed: for, <hi>He that will have honey muſt make much of Bees.</hi> If thou deſire <hi>Felicity,</hi> ſo lead thy Life that God of his goodneſs may bouchſafe to give it thee. Cleanſe thy heart and empty it of evill thoughts, be firm in Faith, eſtabliſh thy Soul with ſoundneſs and ſincerity, be not deceived with damnable Doctrine, nor led aſtray by wrong Opinions. This that I tell thee cannot be done without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, neither can any profitable or good thing be obtained without pains-taking. Thou ſeeſt how Shepheards, Sea-men, and all Artificers, if they grow in wealth, it is by labour and travell.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:102717:20"/>
                  <p>Were the Husbandman any better than a Fool, if he ſhould hope in Harveſt to reap Corn eff his Ground where he hath ſown no Seed, when Seaſon ſerved: Even ſo is that man mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly miſ-informed, that thinking to atchieve perfect Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or to reap true Bleſſedneſſe, having not firſt ſowed his Field with Vertue, good Deeds, Faith, Hope, and Charity, which is the high-way to Heaven. The Husbandman dungeth his Ground, ſoweth his Seed, grafteth his Trees, tarreth his. Sheep, and leadeth his life in Labour, hoping to enjoy the Fruit, the Graffe, the Grain, the Wool, and generally all the Profit: the expectation and full account whereof maketh him to take pains with pleaſure. Even ſo, if thou wilt be concent painfully to walk this way, without regard either of Rocks or Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ains, doubt not to finde true Felicity.</p>
                  <p>Having heard this long and wiſe admonition, and marking the Lady well, I could not be in quiet till I knew her name: Wherefore I ſaid, Madam (without offence be it ſpoken) I pray you what is your name? ſhe anſwered, ſaying; My Son, I am great with God, I am acquainted with the Saints, I am all in all with Angels, I am much eſteemed of good men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me nothing is done in Heaven, and without me no good thing can be done on Earth; I am commonly called <hi>Felicity, Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> I govern good Kings, Princes, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; good Prelates, and Eccleffaſtical Perſons: I ſtop the mouth of falſe Prophets and erroneous Teachers: I hinder their Hereſtes, and flay their wicked proceedings: I govern Houſholders and their Families in good order, I am a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion with the lovers of Learning, I am a Husband to all chaſte Wives, Widows and vertuous Virgins, I reward my Friends in proſperity, with holineſſe, and in adverſity with kinde conſolation; I miniſter unto them Food, Raiment, Lodging, Strength, Patience, and all things neceſſary; and whether it he little or much they take it in good part. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, the friends of <hi>Voluptuouſneſſe</hi> are never ſatisfied, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have too much.</p>
                  <p>My Friends had rather ſing Pſalms than vain Songs: they had rather faſt than be drunk: they had rather pray than curſe: they riſe early and go to bed late: they have care of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth:

                     <p>The Wandring Knight, by the counſell of Folly, left Lady Vertue and followed Voluptuouſneſſe, which led him to the Palace of worldly Felicity.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WHen I had heard both theſe Ladies tell their Tales, I was more amazed than ever I was before, inſomuch that I wiſt not which to take for my Guide. But alas (poor perplexed Pilgrim) if I had had but the wit of a Woodcock, and not wavered in minde, I had followed <hi>Vertue,</hi> and left <hi>Voluptuouſneſſe:</hi> But being amidſt mine amaze, I requeſted my Governeſſe <hi>Folly</hi> to teach me quickly which of theſe two Ladies I were beſt to follow, for the finding of true Felicity. No ſooner had I ſpoken the word, but ſuddenly ſhe caſt out this Language, ſaying that <hi>Vertue</hi> was an Hypocrite, and that her way was painfull to paſſe. But (ſaid ſhe) if you follow <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſſe,</hi> thou ſeeſt her way is fair, ſweet, green, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
                  <p>If thou follow <hi>Vertue,</hi> thou ſubmitteſt thy ſelf to cold, heat, hunger, thirſt, travell, pain, and wearineſſe: thou muſt riſe early, and go to bed late, ſtand in fear, weep, take care, live in forrow, and yet be in doubt to have Felicity at laſt. If thou of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb facs="tcp:102717:21"/>her never ſo little in word or Deed, ſhe will leave thee, for ſhe is too ſevere, even in ſmall trifling matters: Whatſoever ſhe ſaid to thee now ſhe will deny when ſhe hath thee among the Rocks and Mountains: ſhe will leave thee alone among wilde beaſts, to lead thy life in the Wilderneſſe. Wherefore I adviſe thee beleeve her not, and follow her not. But let us take this fair large way on the left hand, through which the greateſt part of people do paſſe, and at night we will lodge in the Palace of <hi>Felicity.</hi> And this I tell thee, that if thou chance to miſlike of thy entertainment there, within a day or two thou mayeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, for the way is but ſhort; and then (if thou think it good) thou mayſt clime over the Mountains, and ride through the way on the right hand.</p>
                  <p>Theſe delicate devices of my friend <hi>Folly</hi> daſhed quite the advertiſements of <hi>Vertue,</hi> whom (with thankſgiving). I bade farewell, deſiring her not to be offended, in that I did not follow her over the Mountains. Then Lady <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> led the way, my horſe <hi>Temerity</hi> trod his Trace, and <hi>Folly</hi> followed faſt at my Heels. <hi>Vertue</hi> viewed us very well, and came ſadly behinde me, even like one that mourneth after a dead Toarſe borne to be buried, crying with a loud voyce: Ah thou arrant Aſſe, leave <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> for ſhe will lead thee to death and deſtruction. The counſel of thy friend <hi>Folly</hi> is devilliſh, ſhe daily deceives ſuch as follow her: <hi>Felicity</hi> is falſe. The language of <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> is a meere charme, wherewith ſhe uſeth to bewitch her children.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding this exclamation and rebuke, I went on my way, and could not away with her Chriſtian counſel: which when ſhe ſaw, ſhe gave me a furious farewell, ſaying: O mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous man, O bedlam beaſt, O fool infortunate, O idiotly Idoll, O ſhadow of man! thou haſt no more ſenſe or reaſon than an Aſſe, thou ſheweſt thy ſelf to be ſhameleſſe, in thus framing thy ſelf to follow <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> and to forſake <hi>Vertue.</hi> Wilt thou embrace worldly wealth rather than heavenly grace? Didſt thou deſtre the Tree before the Fruit? I ſee thou art foully abuſed. He that leaveth <hi>Vertue</hi> and followeth <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Sathan. Remember, O thou wretch, what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith: <hi>For that I have cryed, and thou haſt refuſed to come after me:
<pb facs="tcp:102717:21"/>I ſtayed till the Morrow, but thou underſtoodeſt not but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedſt my counſell, &amp; wouldeſt not receive my correction; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I laugh at thy deſtruction: but when thine evill hap and trouble cometh, then thou ſeckeſt me in the morning when thou ſhalt not finde me, becauſe thou haſt hated knowledge, and haſt not received the fear of God, nor obeyed my counſell, but deſpiſeſt my correction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which words uttered unto me by the mouth of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> might have ſufficed to withdraw me from my fooliſh enterpriſe: But ſhe preached to a poſt; and <hi>Folly,</hi> whom I followed, did mock and deride her all the while.</p>

                     <p>How the Wandering Knight was received and Welcomed to the Pallace of Worldly Felicity.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter we had paſſed certain degrees on our way, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted joy, <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> laid her hands on my head, and gave me her beſt bleſſing, (I letting her alone as one to whom I ought duty.) Then uttered ſhe unto me certain ſweet words, which enchanted me: for preſently I loſt my ſenſes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming all well that ſhe ſaid or did. After we had ſpent in ſport ſome hours of the time, the Sun began to ſet, and ſo I eſpyed the Pallace of worldly Felicity, whereat I was not a little glad: for it ſeemed to me very pleaſant, and me thought I ſmelt dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Whereas indeed all was very witchcraft. When we were within a Croſs-Bow ſhoot of the Pallace, <hi>Voluptuouſneſſe</hi> hoopt and hollowed, whereat came out a Legion of Ladies Pompouſly Apparelled, among whom were theſe next named: <hi>Luſt, Prodigality, Leachery, Wantonneſs, Careleſneſs, Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, Laſciviouſneſs, Ambition, Drunkenneſs Licouriſhneſs,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Being diſmounted from off my Horſe, <hi>Folly</hi> took off my Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and my Face being bare, all the Ladies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> me, and bade me welcome: which entertainment agreed well with my Fooliſh Fancy. Then <hi>Prodigality</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> led me by
<pb facs="tcp:102717:22"/>the hands, <hi>Laſciviouſneſs</hi> and other Ladies led the way before, <hi>Bravery</hi> and the reſt followed after. Thus we entred into the Palace of worldly Pleaſures, the gate whereof was great and high, built with Marble-ſtone, and alwayes ſtood wide open day and night, Winter and Summer, whereat I marvelled much. Then <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> told me the reaſon, with theſe words: I alwayes keep open Houſe for as many as will, and at what hour ſoever any do come to me, by night or by day, they are welcome, and I do receive them royally. Then <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> led me into a great and ſumptuous Hall, hanged with Cloath of Arras, and full of Torches burning round about. There <hi>Luſt</hi> unarmed me, and <hi>Bravery</hi> gave me a night Cown of Crimſon Velver, lined with Martine skins. Within a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Table was covered, in came the fine cates, and to ſupper we go.</p>
                  <p>This done, Lady <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> ſet me in the higheſt place, and there ſate on either ſide of me <hi>Licouriſhneſs</hi> and <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> then the reſt of the Ladies ſate down in their degrees: but <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> ſate right againſt me, who curiouſly carved me of the delicateſt meat. Our Waiters were young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, bravely Apparelled, our Service was ſumptuous, our Meats well ſeaſoned, and handſomly handled: our Cooks were cleanly, our Butlers bountiful, our Servitours were ſingular, our Muſick was excellent, our Singers were ſweet, and every Officer exceeded in delicateneſſe. There was dainty feeding, pleaſant parleying, continuall quaſſing, inſomuch that halfe drunk and whole drunk was a goodly game: ribauldry was our recreation, and as for knavery it was canvaſt to the proofe. When ſupper was ended, Lady <hi>Wantonneſs</hi> came to me, and asked me if I would Dance: And Lady <hi>Luſt</hi> likewiſe, asking me whether I would lye alone, or have a Bedfellow? I made anſwer, that I was weary, by reaſon of my journey, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to go to bed. Then <hi>Laſciviouſneſs</hi> brought me to my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where ſhe lodged me in ſweet Sheets, a ſoft Bed, Curtains of Tiſſue, and all things coſtly and excellent. In concluſion, Lady <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> took her leave, promiſing in the morning to ſhew me the reſt of the Pallace of Worldly Felicity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I dreamed all night, my head was ſo full of toyes.</p>

                  <p>IN the Morning when the Sun beams brightly adorned ſhe Chamber where I lay, I perceived the gallant glaſs Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of coſtly Cryſtall; <hi>Laſciviouſneſs</hi> came unto me and bad me good morrow, asking me if I would riſe. Whereto I anſwered yea, and did ſo with ſpeed: now whiles I was trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming my ſelf, in came <hi>Licouriſhneſs,</hi> and her Siſter <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs,</hi> who had prepared my breakfaſt: anon after came in Lady <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> accompanied with <hi>Luſt, Leachery,</hi> and all the reſt; ſhe was apparelled more like a Goddeſſe than a Queen.

Then I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> to ſhew me the reſt of the Pallace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her promiſe: ſo we walked together, into a goodly great Chamber, hanged about with Cloath of Gold beſet with Pearls. This Chamber was paved with Marble black and white, the Pillars were Iaſper, the Roofe was Ivory laid on with Gold, and the Stairs were Alabaſter.

                  <p>This <hi>Lucifer</hi> arragantly challengeth unto himſelf, that he hath Power to give Glory, Honour, and Riches, to whom he liſteth, as the Scripture witneſſeth; wherefore worldlings do ſerve him as his Subjects. From thence we went to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure-Houſe, where we ſaw Coffers full of Coyn and Iewels, which was kept by Lady <hi>Fortune</hi> (as <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> ſaid) and ſhe beſtowed all that Treaſure on ſuch as the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. From thence we went up into a great Gallery, where we ſaw three Preſſes, the firſt full of fine wollen; the ſecond of pure Silks; the third of fair white Linen: this place <hi>Pomp</hi> had in keeping. From thence we went to the perfuming houſe, which differed nothing from an Apothecaries Shop. For there I found all things that might move a Mans appetite, or ſtirr up his delight. There were colours to paint proud women, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume and Oyntments to make their bodies ſoft and ſweet, and this place was kept by <hi>Laſciviouſneſs.</hi> Then we went into goodly large-Vaults, where wine of no kind wanted, and there was Dame <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> her Kingdome.

From thence to another great Room, where we ſaw a ſort of young ſweet-faced Bodies: <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> told me they were <hi>Ganimedes</hi> and <hi>Endimions.</hi> From thence ſhe had me by to a place that was builded very round in compaſs, which place was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous bright and lightſome, by reaſon of the great Glaſs windowes of Cryſtall. This ſerved them inſtead of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for they had none other: Here we ſaw a great number of fine Delicate Dames, exceeding Amiable and Beautifull; among all, one Excelled, whoſe Name I asked, and <hi>Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> ſhewed me that it was Lady <hi>Venus,</hi> whom all Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Lovers do like notable wel, and honour her as a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe.

And although the Arrow was quickly taken out, and might ſeem to do no harme: yet I think the head thereof was poyſoned, for it hath made ſo deep a wound, as is very infections, and ſcarce cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unleſs with ſome ſpeciall plaiſters. The ſame <hi>Cupid</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth all Leacherous Lovers, of what age ſoever they be, or degree, witneſs daily experience; he is naked and paſt ſhame, not caring who looketh upon him: his blindneſs repreſenteth the Folly of ſuch as run head-long after lewd love, ſetting their Feathers in the wind, without reſpect of any after-clsp. His Bow and Arrowes do ſignine the Folly of Foolls, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be his But, and ſtand ſtill while be doth ſhoot and hit them. His wings ſignifie the wavering minde of ſuch as he hits, who are quiet in no place or time. For who is more mutable, vain, light, inconſtant and variable, than the fleſhly Lover. Some ſay that this <hi>Cupid</hi> hath a Torch burning in his hand, meaning thereby that he burnes to the heart, all them that he toucheth. All this diſpatched, <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> and I went to Dinner; and ſhe promiſed me when I had dined, to ſhew me the reſt of the Pallace.</p>

                     <p>Dinner being done, Voluptuouſneſs ſheweth the Wandring Knight the reſt of the Pallace of Worldly Felicity, with the deſcription of the Towers thereof. And by the Author is declared the evill Fruit of certain notorious ſins.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THis chanced in the pleaſant Month of <hi>May,</hi> when Love and Luſt is moſt in force: ſo it was determined, that we ſhould Sup in goodly Gardens; not in Banqueting Houſes, although they were Wonderfull fine, but in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hours Over-grown with Sweet Eglantine, Roſe-trees, and Vines; fair, and clear Fonntains of cold water running by, and fragrant Herbs and Flowers caſting a comfortable Scent. The little pretty Birds did ſing round about us, as well in Cages, as on Trees, and Buſhes. There was playing, piping ſinging, dancing, leaping, embracing, and kiſſing: Finally,
<pb facs="tcp:102717:24"/>each Lover with his Lady was merry; and to be brief, every one did what liked him veſt, and thought themſelves happy to find ſuch Felicity. But all my deſire was, to ſee the reſt of the Pallace: wherefore I charged Lady <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> with her promiſe, which took effect, inſomuch that we went all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a certain place, where I ſaw the very ſecret Lodgings of <hi>Voluptuouſneſs.</hi> But what they were, for fear of offending the Reverend Reader, I mean not to rehearſe: then we went from Gallery to Gallery, from Office to Office, from Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to Chamber, where I ſaw every place furniſhed with ſo rich Movables, and ſuch choyce, as nothing can be wiſhed more.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt all thoſe Rooms one Chamber exceeded in largneſs and Workmanſhip, for coſtly Carving, and in all other reſpects. There I ſound a very brave Bed Gorgeouſly trimmed, inſomuch that I commended the ſame highly. Then <hi>Laſciviouſneſs</hi> ſaid that ſhe had charge of that Chamber, and if I liſted to lye there that Night, I ſhould. <hi>Luſt</hi> alſo promiſed to bring Lady <hi>Venus</hi> to lye with me. I hearing this, me thought I felt the wound that <hi>Cupid</hi> gave me as freſh as at the firſt: Then went we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Walls which were all of Iet, Thick and Strong: Vpon theſe Walls were built ſeven Towers likeunto Steeples, and every Tower had his owner: In the firſt Ledged <hi>Pride,</hi> in the Second <hi>Envy,</hi> in the Third <hi>Wrath,</hi> in the Fourth <hi>Gluttony,</hi> in the Fift <hi>Leachery,</hi> in the Sixth <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> and in the Seventh <hi>Sloath.</hi> My purpoſe was to go unto them all one after another. And as I entred into the Lower of <hi>Pride,</hi> which was the firſt, I ſpied Written this Poſsy over the Porch, <hi>PRIDE IS THE PRINCE AND ROOT OF ALL SINS.</hi> For as a King accompanied with a great Train of Servitours, even ſo hath <hi>Pride</hi> a ſort of Sins for her Subjects, over whom ſhe Reigneth Prince like. Again, as Kings keep and hold their own right, even ſo doth <hi>Pride</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have her ſelf toward the proud. It is a ſingular ſign of a great Reprobate and eaſt-away, when a Man liveth long in <hi>Pride.</hi> For this ſin diſpleaſeth God more than all other Vices, as humility pleaſeth him more than all other vertues. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the proud advance themſelves above all orver, the Devill dealeth with them accordingly: For as the Crow when he in
<pb facs="tcp:102717:24"/>not able to crack a hard Walnut with his Bill, taketh his flight aloft right over a great ſtone, and letting it fall, breaketh the ſame, and then alighteth to eat the kernell, even ſo playeth the Tevill with the proud, for firſt he advanceth them aloſt, and bringeth them to promotion in this World, but when they are in the top of their happineſs, and think upon no danger, then, even then comes the Devil and throwes them down head-long with a miſchief, into Hell.</p>
                  <p>The difference between the humble and the proud, may be known by that of Corn and Chaffe. For as Chaffe being light is puft up aloſt with the winde, and is ſuddenly Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, whereas contrariwiſe good Corn lying low, is gaſhered from the ground, laid up in Garners, and eſteemed of every body: even ſo it falleth out with the pride of the proud, and the Humility of the Humble. Vnto Pride do appertain theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces following: namely <hi>Arrogancy, Preſumption, Contempt, Hereſie, Hypocriſie, Diſobedience, Vain-glory, Ambition,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond Tower lodged <hi>Envy,</hi> over whoſe Entry-doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e this device was Written, <hi>FIRE-BRAND OF HELL, AND THE DEVILS DARLING.</hi> Now <hi>Envy</hi> is a Sadneſſe and Heavineſſe of Heart for anothers Proſperity. This Sin hath Saveraignty in the had, as Charity in the good. <hi>Charity</hi> is a Badge of Salvation, <hi>Envy</hi> of Damnation. The envyous Man differs not from the Devill in any Degree, they are Partners in gain and in loſs. If the Devill reap profit by doing evill, the envious Man will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ſure to follow his trade, for lucre ſake. And as the envious Man grudgeth at anothers profit and good name: ſo doth he delight in anothers loſs and ill Report: Where cannot be a ſouler and more cruell Sin than <hi>Envy:</hi> for ſhe alwayes tormenteth and vexeth her Foſterer, I mean the envious, in whem ſhe dwelleth. He that ſeeketh to get good by others evill, never amends in that minde. And he that planteth his pleaſure upon anothers pain, ſhall have ſuch fruit, as he that graſts Figs on Thorns: or would make Fire to burn by pouring Weſer thereon. <hi>Envy</hi> is a diſeaſe hard to be healed, becauſe it lyeth hidden in the heart, where the Phyſtrian cannot come to cure it. There belongs unto this Vice, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
<pb facs="tcp:102717:25"/>Malice, Slander, Diſdain, Treachery,</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p>In the third Lower dwelt <hi>Wrath,</hi> over whoſe Porch this Poſey was written, <hi>THE VERY MURTHERER OF HOLY LOVE.</hi> For as <hi>holy Love</hi> prepares the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to dwell with God, ſo doth <hi>Wrath</hi> prepare it to dwell with the Devill; <hi>Wrath</hi> taketh away the hearing of Reaſon. The Wrathfull Man will hear the Counſell of none. There is nothing Reſembles the Image of God more than Man being in perfect Love. For God will be there where Vnity is kept, where People be at peace, and where Countreys be quiet: which cannot be in Wrathfull Wretches. A Wrathfull Man is like unto one poſſeſſed with a Devill, who is ever tormented untill he hath vomited him out. <hi>Wrath</hi> maketh Men fight, <hi>Wrath</hi> cauſeth Blaſphemy, by <hi>Wrath</hi> the Devil conquereth Countreys, <hi>Wrath</hi> is like a muzled Dog; For when he cannot bite, yet with ſnarling he makes others go together by the ears. And as the Fiſher-man troubleth the Water, becauſe the Fiſh ſhould not ſee his Nets, even ſo the Devil by <hi>Wrath</hi> troubleth Man, to the end he ſhould not underſtand nor perceive his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. To the wrathfull Man belongs <hi>inflaming of the heart, Indignation, Diſorder, Blaſphemy, Contention, Rancour, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengement, Murther,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>In the Fourth Tower dwelt <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> whoſe Poſey is this: <hi>IDOLATRY AND A BOTTOMLESSE GULFE ARE INSATIABLE.</hi> The covetous man is forſaken of God, for he loves his gain better than God: he had rather loſe God than Goods. For little trifles that touch his profit he ſwears and lies, which is a thing moſt damnable. The <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> which he ſhould have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> turnes it to Riches. The covetous Mans heart is all upon his Goods, and not upon God; for where the heart is, there is alſo a Mans love. The covetous Man offendeth in evil getting, in evill uſing, and in evill loving his goods, The Covetous Man is governed by the Devill, hazarding his Soul to eternall torment for the lewd Love of Temporall toyes. And as the Mouſe is caught in the Trap, whiles ſhe hopeth to get the Bait, even ſo is the covetous Man by the Devil, in hunting after Riches. The covetous Man is like
<pb facs="tcp:102717:25"/>unto a Hog, whoſe life doth little good to any Man, but rather great harm, by reaſon of the noyſomneſs and filthy ſtink which that naſty Beaſt procureth: but when the Butcher hath killed him, then he yields profit, becauſe it nouriſheth, &amp;c. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo the covetous Man whiles he liveth doth good to none, but rather damnifies his Neighbours: but, when Gods ſlaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (<hi>Death</hi> I mean) comes and deſtroyeth him, then thoſe that live fare the vetter. The Covetous man is like a Band dog, that ſeedeth upon Carrion, and will admit no companion to take part with him, but eating all alone, and filling his guts till he burſt, he dyeth, and the Fewles of the Air devour him. The covetous man hordeth his goods, and ſuffereth the needy to ſtarve. The covetous Man croweth over the poor, the Devil croweth over him. And upon covetouſueſs attend theſe Monſters, <hi>Uſury, Simony, Fraud, Perjury,</hi> and all <hi>Sacriledge, Deceipt, Extortion, Oppreſſion,</hi> and the <hi>Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the fifth Tower dwelt <hi>Gluttony,</hi> over whoſe Portall this Poſey was Written, <hi>VENOMOUS WINE AND DEADLY DAINTIES.</hi> Truth it is, that the throat is the gate of the Body, you know that when an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy would winne a Caſtle, if once he get in at the Gate, he makes no doubt of winning the held: even ſo the Devil, when he hath entred in at the Throat, it is no queſtion but he would winn both the heart and body. Now his cuſtome is to enter with many Sins, of which <hi>Cluttony</hi> is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the Drunkard and Immoderate Feeder conſenteth to all Vice. Therefore it is renuiſte to ſet a good Porter to keep the Throat, leſt the Devil get in. For as a Man may lead a Horſe when he hath him by the Bridle: even ſo may the Devil rule a Man, having once gotten hold of his mouth by <hi>Gluttony,</hi> yea he then poſſeſſeth himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant being Corn-ſed, oftentimes rebelleth againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: even ſo the Body having received exceſs and more than enough, is apt to Revel againſt the Spirit. <hi>Gluttony</hi> kils more than the Sword of the Enemy, it makes many to dye ſooner then they ſhould by Nature. Exceſſive Eating and Drinking corrupteth the Body, and iugendereth diſeaſes. By <hi>Gluttony</hi> Men be franked, as Capons are crammed. A
<pb facs="tcp:102717:26"/>Glutton is worſe then a Hog that feedeth filthily, and yet the Hog is like the Sire, of whom he takes his manners, and doth but his kind.</p>
                  <p>They that make Taverns their Temples, are like a Hogge wallowing in the mire. For as the filthy Hog tumbleth in the mire and dirt, even ſo do Gluttons and Drunkards oftentimes wallow in damnable <hi>Drunkenneſs and Gluttony.</hi> Vpon this foul Sin other Sins do depend, as namely, <hi>Greedineſs of meat, Devouring, Daintineſs, Exceſs, Dulneſs of feeling, Fooliſh mirth, Vain-babling, Ribauldry, and bold beaſtlineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſixth Tower lived <hi>Leachery,</hi> whoſe Poſey was <hi>A COMMON AND FILTHY WHORE DEFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LETH BOTH BODY AND SOUL.</hi> For the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of a Harlot corrupteth a Man within and without. Of all Sins, this Sin of <hi>Leachery</hi> is the pleaſanteſt to the Devil, becauſe it hurteth both Body and Soul, and becauſe he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver toucht with it, being a Spirit, and no Body. Were not the Merchant a flat fool to make any Bargain, knowing before that he ſhall repent it after? Even ſo the Leacher takes much pains, he ſpends his Goods to accompliſh his deſire, but afterwards he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repenteth both his pains, his coſt, and his purchaſe: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, with that repentance he is not forgiven of God, unleſs a full purpoſe and reſolute intent of amendment iſſue and follow he reupon. The Leacher in his Life is three wayes tormented: firſt, with the heat of a Harlot: ſecondly, with the pain of his hurt: and thirdly, with the worm of his own Conſcience. He burnes in Concupiſcence, he ſtinks with infamy, his Conſcience accuſeth him for his offence. Leachery is a ditch wherein the Devil hurles other Sins. To behold a Woman wantonly is a great alluring to <hi>Leachery,</hi> ſo that good were it, not to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her at all, but much better not to touch or meddle with her carnally. Six other Sins wait upon <hi>Leachery,</hi> to wit, <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Adultery, Sacriledge, Inceſt, Buggery,</hi> and <hi>Rape.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſeventh Tower dwelt <hi>Sloath,</hi> whoſe Poſey was, <hi>A SLOTHFULL HUSWIFE AND ALWAYES SLEEP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING.</hi> Sloath is a heavineſs of heart, and an hatred of ſpiritual goodneſs, whereby a Man is made negligent in ſerving of God, either by good words proceeding from the mouth, or good works
<pb facs="tcp:102717:26"/>iſſuing from the heart, both which God himſelf willeth. It is moſt fit to acknowledge a Creator, and an encreaſer of that good and goodneſs which we daily receive: as alſo to confeſs our ſelves Sinners, and God the forgiver. But as People are dull to do good deeds, ſo are they ſwift to commit Sin. Many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils grow by <hi>Sloath,</hi> whereof two be perillous, and <hi>Sloath</hi> her ſelf confeſſeth no leſs: namely, to neglect a converting unto Chriſt, and a careleſneſs of confeſſing Sin, Whereby it cometh to paſs, that oftentimes many depart this Life, not confeſſing themſelves to have offended God, neither yet converting or turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him: in doing whereof they hazard both body and ſoul. It is a hard thing for one to dye well, that alwayes lived ill. In this Tower of <hi>Sloath</hi> are fifteen ſeveral lodges or cabins: in the firſt, liveth <hi>Luke-Warmneſs;</hi> in the ſecond, <hi>Laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> in the third, <hi>Drowſineſs;</hi> in the fourth, <hi>Careleſneſs of himſelf and his Health;</hi> in the fifth, <hi>Delaying the time to do good;</hi> in the ſixth, <hi>Retchfulneſs;</hi> in the ſeventh, <hi>Daſtardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> in the eighth, <hi>Undevoutneſs;</hi> in the ninth, <hi>Heavineſs of heart, or hatred to ſerve God;</hi> in the tenth, <hi>Wearineſs of life;</hi> in the eleventh, <hi>Deſperation;</hi> in the twelfth <hi>Unſtaidneſs;</hi> in the thirteenth, <hi>Unconſtancy;</hi> in the fourteenth <hi>Murmuring,</hi> in the fifteenth, <hi>Unpatience.</hi> And thus much of the ſeven Towers built upon the Wall, and the dwelling in the ſame.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THis Palace was ſituated or built in a pleaſant Valley, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foot of a high Mountain, invironed with Hils on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſide, whereby it was not only defended from force of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, which way ſoever the Winds blew, but the very Hills themſelves were very ſightly and ſerviceable. For on the one was a goodly Vineyard, wherein grew Grapes of ſundry ſorts: on the other ſide it yielded great quantity of grain: on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:102717:27"/>ſide where high Woods, which yielded great ſtore of good Timber, and Trees wherein bred all manner of Birds; on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide were Warrens and Conny-borows full of Hares and Connies: in another place was a goodly Park, wherein was no want of Deer, Red or Fallow. Beyond theſe Hils were goodly Forreſts, full of Gentlemanly Game for hunting. In the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley where the palace ſtood was a marvellous fair green Medow, thorow the middeſt whereof ran a River of fine freſh water, upon the brims whereof on both ſides along grew Apple-trees, Pear-trees, Plum-trees, Olive-trees, Elder-trees, Oke-trees, Elme-trees, and ſuch like: faſt by the goodly Bank alſo grew many young Hazel-trees, full of Nuts, at the time of the year, and by that again ſuch ſtore of Walnut-trees, as paſs to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, beſides many Ponds full of Fiſh, and excellent Orchards of all kinds of Fruit, and goodly Gardens alſo of ſweet flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The River was not without great ſtore of Water-fowles; and as for the Wood, there bred in it Hawks, Hernes, Peli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, Pheaſants, Cranes, Wood-cocks, Bittors, Kites, Crowes, Cormorants, Turtles, Woodquiſts, Eagles; to be ſhort, all kind of Birds poſſible, as might be perceived by Feathers, which fell from them to the ground pruning themſelves. What ſhould I ſpeak of Pigeon Houſes, and of ſecret Banquetting pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, fine and delicate? why it were but Folly. Belide all this, you muſt think that there were Tennis-Courts, and all other places of Paſtime; the Wals whereof were very high, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it would have made one amazed and dizzie to look down from the top. There was alſo a marvellous Moat and ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to behold, the bridge whereof was not broad, and called <hi>Deſperation,</hi> the paſſage over being a long narrow Plank, ſo that if one went awry, he fell in, with hazzard never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. The Stables were full of goodly horſes, as Hobbies, Iennets, Barled Horſes, Geldings, Hackneys, Mules, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, and Colts. The Kennels full of Dogs, as Gray-hounds, Otter-hounds, Hare-hounds, Spaniels, for Land and Water, Maſtives for Bull, Bear, and Boor.

Now when I waxed weary, I took my leave of the Company with good night: and then was brought to the braveſt Chamber in all the Palace, Lady <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and her waiting maids tending upon me.

                  </argument>
                  <p>SO long as the Knight continued in this peſtilent Palace of Worldly Deſire, following his own Fantaſie, by Vain <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs</hi> enticed, he did no other thing but play the tool, Dance, Leap, Sing, Eat, Drink, Hawk, Hunt, Fiſh, hunt Whores, and ſuch like, (as did the Prodigal Son) and lead a diſſolutè life, for the ſpace of eleven dayes, which ſignifies a marvellous myſtery, and unfortunate. For the Number Eleven by the Opinion of Chriſtian Doctors, and Philoſophers, is a wicked and unlucky number; for that the number ten ſignifies, the ten Commandements of God, the number of Eleven which is one more, propheſieth and ſore-telleth the tranſgreſſion of them. Wherefore the Knight having remained eleven dayes in the Palace grievouſly tranſgreſſing the will of God, letting looſe the bridle of his own affections, without refraining any of them: if you note well the premiſes, and ſee into the ſenuel, you ſhall find, that ſuch as live after the order of the Palace of worldly Felicity, being given to follow the pomp and Pride of the World, with the Pleaſures and Voluptuouſneſs of the ſame, and ſeem willing to lead that life, without purpoſe of change, nay rather, triumphing and rejoycing therein; I ſay truly, that ſuch are Tranſgreſſors of Gods Lawes. Contrariwiſe, ſuch as account themſelves here to he but Pilgrims, and fix
<pb facs="tcp:102717:28"/>their affection on the other World, where Ieſus Chriſt raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in glory, reputing this life an exile, and deſtring to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of it, to the end they may enter in at the Pallace of the heavenly King, ſhall enjoy the fulneſs and happineſs thereof.</p>
                  <p>As this World yields a great deal of Temporal goods and Tranſitory Honour, ſo doth it alſo make an end of them. Now theſe that uſe theſe gifts to the glory of God, are Gods people. Contrariwiſe thoſe that do uſe them voluptuouſly, are Veſſels of the Devil, and tranſgreſſours of the Lawes of God, as may appear by the Ten Commandements, which I have ſet down for that purpoſe. Wherein all Worldlings may perceive that by living voluptuouſly they grievouſly tranſgreſs Gods Laws, to their own deſtruction. And as the Ten Commandements were written in two Tables, even ſo are they divided into two parts. The firſt comprehends four, concerning the Love of God: The ſecond, ſix, touching the love of your Neighbour. And therefore who ſo loſeth his Life Worldling-like, and fixeth his Felicity in <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> is doubtleſs a Veſſel of the Devil, and loveth not God nor his Neighbour, becauſe he tranſgreſſeth the Law of God, which followeth in due and convenient order.</p>

                     <p>The Knight rode to recreate himſelf, and view the warrens and Forreſts, which were about the pallace of worldly Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, anon he ſaw it ſink ſuddenly into the Earth, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himſelf faſt in the mire up to the ſaddle.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter I had ſojourned eleven dayes in the Pallace, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing Gods Commandements and leading a beaſtly life I deſired to ride into the Forreſts thereabouts, not intending to give over my Voluptuous life, but for my pleaſure, becauſe I was weary of making good chear. For although Worldlings delight to eat, drink, dance, leap, ſing, ride, run, and ſuch like; yet notwithſtanding they cannot continue in this trade of Life, without intermingling it with ſome other recreation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they often leave (by conſtraint) their paſtimes, though
<pb facs="tcp:102717:29"/>they intend to return thereto again. They do not utterly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, but break off for a ſeaſon to procure them better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. I then being weary, was willing to ſee the Warrens, and other pleaſures, which when my governeſs <hi>Folly</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſhe told the ſame to Lady <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> and ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to Hunt or Hawk with me, whereof I was right glad. Then I apparelled my ſelf in Hunters guiſe; inſtead of my Helmet, a Hat full of Feathers; for mine Armour, an Horn, and I leapt upon <hi>Temerity</hi> my Horſe: <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> had a Hobby, <hi>Folly</hi> a Ienner, and the other Ladies every one of them a Palfrey. There came the Huntſmen with Grey-hounds and Maſtives, hooping, hollowing, and galloping together, ſome one way, ſome another. The dogs were at a beck, up ſtarts the Hare, the cry was pleaſant to hear. But in the midſt of all our paſtime, I chanced to breathe my Horſe, and turning towards the Palace of Worldly Felicity, ſuddenly I ſaw it ſtuk into the Earth, and every Body therein. But what la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Out-cries they made, you that have reaſon are to judge: then did there ariſe amongſt us a Whirl-wind, with an Earth-quake, which ſet us all aſunder, in ſo much that I and my Horſe ſunk in mire up to the Saddle: all this while my miſtreſs <hi>Folly</hi> only remained with me. This Earth-quake yielded ſuch an Air of Brimſtone, that the like hath not been felt: then I perceived that I was far from the pleaſant Palace, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Orchards, and Vine-yards of <hi>Voluptuouſneſs;</hi> and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a beaſtly Bog ſticking faſt, and nothing near me but Serpents, Snakes, Adders, Toads, and Venomous wormes. Such was my perplexity in this caſe, That I fell into deſpair, being not able to ſpeak one word, I was ſo ſore amazed: but when I came again to my ſelf, revived from death to life, and found my ſelf in that beaſtly Bog, I tare my hair, I rent my cloaths, I wept, I wailed, I howled, I cryed, I wrung my hands, I ſtruck my breaſt, I ſcracht my face, I bit my Armes, and ſpake thus: O Wretch, O Aſs, O Miſerable Fool, O Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, O Fondling, where is now thy Palace of Worldly Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity? Where are now thy brave Chambers, hanged with cloth of Arras: Where are now thy gallant Gardens, Orchards, thy Meadowes, thy Corn-fields, thy Coffers of Coin, thy
<pb facs="tcp:102717:29"/>Ladies ſo lovely, thy hawks, thy Hounds, thy Horſes, thy Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, thy Servants, thy ſoft beds, thy good chear, thy Wives, thy Muſick, thy Pleaſure, and all the things which thou haſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed? Alas wicked Wretch, how haſt thou been deceived, thou thoughteſt thou hadſt been in the Palace of true Felicity, and for <hi>Felicity</hi> thou findeſt <hi>Vanity:</hi> Thou haſt been wickedly enchanted thus to find evill in ſtead of good. Herewithall I turned my ſelf toward <hi>Folly,</hi> and railed at her, ſaying: O cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, cruell, and deceitfull beaſt, O monſtrous mocker of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, O filthy Bawd, O Venemous Viper: Is this the good hap I ſhould have? Is this the palace of <hi>Felicity,</hi> whither thou wouldeſt bring me?</p>
                  <p>Curſed be the day that ever I ſaw thee, curſed be the day that ever I heard thee, curſed be the day that ever I believed thee, curſed be the day that ever I followed thee. It is even ſo? that thus thou governeſt, even beaſtly and damnably? Is it even ſo? that thou leadeſt people even to Perdition? Where is the Felicity thou promiſedſt me? Where is the good hap I ſhould have by thee? It is chanced to me even as I doubted by the way, when thou diſcoveredſt thy filthy Feats, beginnings, and proceedings, howbeit thine enchantments and thy flattery cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me to keep thee company, when full fain, God wot, I would have been rid of thee. But ſuch was my arrogant igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ignorant arrogancy, that I followed thy dangerous Counſel. When I had thus ſcolded and took on, the lewd loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel loudly laught me to ſcorn. Whereat being in a rage, I offered to draw my ſword, but it would not be: then I ſpurred my horſe, but he could not lift up his legs. Notwithſtanding for all this I carryed the mind ſtill I might get out not having help, even by mine own ſtrength and induſtry. But be you ſure of this, that after a Man be once ſunk in, and drowned in fleſhly Voluptuouſneſs, he ſhall ſtick faſt, and not be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelf, unleſs he have the help of <hi>Gods Grace,</hi> which he of his goodneſs give us all.

                  <p>O Wicked Worlding, O Traytour, O Lyar, O damnable deceiver, armed with filthy fraud and curſed craftineſs, having a face like a man, but a tayle like a Dragon, who with thy peſtilent prating promiſeſt that which thou never wilt nor canſt perform: <hi>to wit,</hi> peace, reſt, aſſarance, bleſſing, and felicity. Whereas contrariwiſe thou ſheweſt thy ſelf Vain, Cruell, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, uncertain, curſed, and deſperate. And becauſe thou wouldeſt beſtow thy peyſons, and not be perceived, thou cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it with a little honey of delight. O fooliſh Worldlings and lovers of <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> why ſuffer you your ſelves to be ſo fouly abuſed? Why fly you not from her, ſince you know ſhe is damnable? Why do you believe a Lyar? Why do you follow a deceiver? Why become you acquainted with ſuch a Murtherer? Why do you not purge your underſtanding of Erronious O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions? Why conſider ye not what the World is with a perfect Iudgment? If you did all this, you ſhould find your ſelves out of the way. For Worldly goods, Voluptuouſneſs, and Pleaſure, are mingled rather with Sowre things than with ſweet.</p>
                  <p>In following <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> you are not happy, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, not Wiſe, but flat Fools. Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith: <hi>All that is in the world is Concupiſcence of the fleſh, Concupiſcence of the eyes, and Concupiſcence of Pride. The world and all her Concupiſcence ſhall paſs: but he that doth the will of the Lord ſhall continue eternally.</hi> Hearken ye fooliſh Worldlings, hearken you Veſſels of <hi>Voluptuouſneſs.</hi> This teacheth you aſſuredly, wherein conſiſteth all your Felicity, and how it is damnable. Conſider Saint <hi>Johns</hi> words, <hi>That the world ſhall paſs, and the Concupiſcence of the ſame:</hi> What meant he by the World? nothing elſe but, as Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith, All world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and lovers of <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> which preferr viſible things before inviſible, the fleſh before the Spirit, Satan
<pb facs="tcp:102717:30"/>before Ieſus Chriſt: even as commonly we call a houſe good or bad according to the uſage of them that dwell in it. The eye, the fleſh, and the pomp of life is the Worldlings Felicity, that is, their Heaven. In all goodneſs come of God, (as ſure the coucupiſcence of the eye, the fleſh, and the pride and pomp of Life cometh of the Devil) are not they deceived that think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t good, or ſir their affection to follow it? I could ſay, there is a gnawing Conſcience to terment the Worldings. I could ſay, that the Voluptuous man hath the wrath of God hanging e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his head: I could ſay, eternal death is reſerved for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. A for exceſſive eating and drinking, centes farfets, Head-ach, laſs of wit, dropſtes, loſs of appetite, griping of the guts, palſies, weakning of the body, infamy, and ſhame. Now to Venery, wherein the Voluptuous Man taketh ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as in nothing more: Firſt, what gains, what forrows, what torments and anguiſh hath the Lewd Lover, before he can compaſs his deſire? his desſire cannot be atchieved without loſs: For we ſee that Leachery and Gluttony breedeth pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is a very heavy burthen. But imagine it coſteth nothing, as oftentimes it chanceth among ſuch as be rich, yet notwitiſtanding they feel even what ſo lowes, namely loſs of Body and Soul. Touching the ſin of Leachery a man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is like unto a beaſt; for in his blind delight he is deprived of reaſon, and therefore the deed declareth it ſelf to be damnable. This Sin bringeth her reward in this World, as Dropſies, Palſies, Leproſies, Gowts, Burnings, Batches, and French Pox, which is the very worſt, the commeniſt, the loathſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and the moſt infectious diſeaſe of all: beſides that, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from all honeſt company, decay of Strength, and loſs of good Name and Fame. Do you account him a happy Man which ſpends his dayes in Drunkenneſs and Leachery, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving here ſo many H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ls? abſtinence or forbearance doth not warn them to take heed thereof, though it be the only medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. Now touching Concupiſcence of the eyes, whereby co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs and deſire of Riches is underſtood: Firſt, though Gold and ſilver be but Earth, what vexation hath the covetous Man to atchieve it? He ſaileth over tempeſtuous Seas, he climeth over Monſtrons Mountains, he diggeth deep into the
<pb facs="tcp:102717:31"/>bowels of the Earth, he ſuffereth hunger, thirſt, cold, heat, and a thouſand miſchiefs. One is drowned, another killed, the third robbed, and he that hath obtained his purpoſe, liveth in fear to loſe it: the covetous Man ſuſpects every body. It is not Coffers full of Coin, that can make men happy: Our Saviour terms it Traſh and Thornes, becauſe it pricks the heart, and corrupteth both Body and Soul. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that wiſheth Wealth in this World, falleth into temptation:</hi> Is not <hi>Judas</hi> an Example, who in caſe of covetouſnes hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Now to Coucupiſcence of <hi>Pride.</hi> He that hath Honour, Authority, Might, Eſtimation, and Dignity in this World, thinketh he is happy, but ſuch are loden with unhappineſs: for what pains, labour, and vexation endureth the ambitious Man, before he can come to dignity, Honour and Authority? And when he hath it with all theſe vexations, he is not ſure how long he ſhall enjoy it. We ſee oftentimes Fortune turns her Wheel, and that the Ambitious end their Libes with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy. Take an Example of <hi>Priamus</hi> King of <hi>Troy,</hi> who flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in Friends, and Riches, Honour, Might, Kindred, and Children: did not he and his Off-ſpring, the greateſt part of them dye moſt miſerably: as for the reſt, they became Servitors, and were at length killed in <hi>Troy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Croeſus</hi> King of the <hi>Lydians,</hi> as rich and mighty as he was, after he had raigned fifteen years, he was Vanquiſhed by King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> loſt his Realm, was carryed away Captive, and led all the reſt of his life like a Slave.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dionyfius</hi> the cowardly King of <hi>Sicill,</hi> was hunted out of his Realm, and became ſo poor, that he kept a Schoole in <hi>Corinth,</hi> and by teaching little Children he got his living very poorly, God wot, and beggerly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mithridate,</hi> King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> a rich and mighty Prince, he ſubdued twelve Nations, wherein ſome ſay all Languages were ſpoken, yet he for all that, after he had wearied the World with Wars, was forſaken of his own People, purſued by his own Son, and overcome by ſubtilty: inſomuch that he was glad to deſire a Frenchman to kill him, who did ſo, and that was his end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Valerianus</hi> the great Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> even he that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
<pb facs="tcp:102717:31"/>the Chriſtians, and did much miſchief, was taken by his Enemy the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who againſt the Law of Arms, made him lye down, whiles he trode on his back to leap on his Horſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bajazet</hi> the fourth King of the <hi>Turks,</hi> was Vanquiſhed by <hi>Tamberlane</hi> a <hi>Tartarian,</hi> and King of <hi>Scythia,</hi> who kept him in a Cage like a beaſt, and with a Golden Chain led him, like a Spaniel, throughout all the Army: yea, he was glad to feed under <hi>Tamberlanes</hi> Table, like a dog. And therefore let this be a concluſion, that Honour, Authority, and Dignity is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritage. Moreover, what Labours, Trabels, Verations and Perils do Princes paſs through even at the preſent, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves in their Eſtates? What Wars and ſlaughters have been committed partly to get, and partly to keep rule and Regiment? Ambitious Worldlings cannot play with their pleaſures, if they have not firſt paſſed ſome of theſe Vexations. In youth men run their race without regard of Conſcience, but when age comes on, and nothing left for Luſt: when White hairs, a Walking ſtaffe or crutch, a pair of ſpectacles, Cotton put in their ears, when none of theſe things can help them, then muſt they endure the gnawing of Conſcience, which <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> kept hidden a long time. Whatſoever is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to youth, the ſame is unpleaſant to Age. And what comfort may an Old Man conceive, when he can think upon no time of his youth, that was well ſpent and Vertuouſly beſtowed. What diſcomfort is it, when Conſcience accuſes the old man of his young years wickedly waſted: But as the Elect live in hope, ſo do the Reprobate in deſpair. He that followeth <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> is Gods enemy. For Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that loves the World hateth God.</hi> You may well think, that Sin is hated of God, when he ſuffered his only Son to dye upon the Altar of the croſs for this end, that Sin ſhould not be unpuniſhed. And why was it, but becauſe the Sins of <hi>Adam</hi> encreaſed, as Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions multiplyed? The evill rich Man that lived at his luſt, was Tormented in Hell with fire and thirſt, in whom the words of our Saviour Chriſt are verified, ſaying, <hi>Woe unto you that now laugh, for you ſhall lament and weep.</hi> Go to you fooliſh Worldlings therefore, and you Vain Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb facs="tcp:102717:32"/>perſons, vaunting your ſelves happy in following your fleſhly appetites, when for ſuch pleaſures you ſhall ſuffer tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not in this World, but in the World to come, you will ſing a new note.</p>
                  <p>But now to our Knight, whom we left in the mire, and deep ditch of Sin. I refer you to the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>36.98.72.143.</hi> and there you ſhall find the truth, that Worldly Felicity is no other thing, than Vanity, dreams, and meer a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uſes; and alſo that Worldlings are accurſed and unhappy. Wherefore I beſeech you in the name of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt to uſe the goods of this world, as Pilgrims uſe their Lodgings, and ſuch fare as they find in their Voyage, <hi>that is,</hi> not to ſet your hearts upon them, nor ſo to love them that nothing be leſt for the Lord. For as the Knight ſaw the Palace of wordly Felicity ſink ſuddenly, with all her people, and pomp: even ſo ſhall it happen unto all Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous worldings, at the dreadfull day of Iudgment, unleſs they return from their wicked wayes, forſake Sin, embrace a new liſe, and ſerve the Lord in holineſs and righteouſneſs.

                  </argument>
                  <p>I Have declared in the firſt part of my Voyage, how being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by <hi>Folly,</hi> in contemning <hi>Vertue,</hi> and following <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> I entred into the Palace of falſe Felicity, there reſting my ſelf for a certain ſeaſon, and tranſgreſſing all the Commandements of God, in leading a diffolute and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life, thinking that by living ſo I might be happy; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed I was unhappy. And why? becauſe that in ſtead of Felicity I found Vanity: For as I thought to recreate my ſelf in hunting, I ſaw the Palace of <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> ſink, and come to utter confuſion, and my ſelf alſo plunged into the pit of Sin, even up to the ſaddle. It is an eaſie matter for a Man of himſelf to fall into Hell, but it is impoſſible for him to get out again, unleſs by the help of <hi>Gods Grace:</hi> I term him to be in Hell, who lives in continuall wickedneſs, committing Sin with delight. For if he dye in that Eſtate, Hell is his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but in this liſe if he repent, there is hope of Salvation:
<pb facs="tcp:102717:33"/>For by <hi>Gods Grace</hi> he may be comforted and delivered. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Man of himſelf falleth into Perdition, but without <hi>Gods Grace</hi> he cannot riſe up again. God therefore ſeeing his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture given to all Vanity, led with Ambition of Worldly hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and not ceaſing his ſinfull Life, oftentimes ſends Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, Diſeaſes, Diſhonours, and confuſion in the World, to make him humble, and ſo open the eyes of Reaſon, which <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs</hi> had ſhut up, whereby he may come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Sins, and confeſs the ſame to God. All this is figured in the Goſpel, where our Lord Ieſus raiſed the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes Child, which was carryed out of the City of <hi>Naim</hi> to be buryed, he commanded the Bearers to ſtay, and having touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Coſſin of the Corps, with a loud Voice he ſaid, <hi>Young man,</hi> ariſe, and ſtraight way the dead body roſe up and ſpake: Which done, the Lord delivered him to his ſorrowfull Mother. The mourning Mother myſtically repreſents the Church, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting for her dead Children, <hi>to wit,</hi> Wicked Worldlings, and Voluptuous Chriſtians, which are worſe than dead Corſes. The Widdowes child repreſenteth ſouls dead in Sin. The Coffin repreſenteth the naturall body, wherein lyeth the ſinfull Soul. The four Bearers carrying the dead Soul to Hell, repreſent hope of long life, cuſtome of ſinning, delaying of repentance, and contempt of Gods words. Nevertheleſs, when our Lord will raiſe to life this dead Soul, he commandeth the Bearers to ſtay, afterwards toucheth the Body, ſending upon Sinners Adverſity, Diſeaſes, and Misfortunes: but all that ſufficeth not, unleſs the Lord ſay unto the Soul, <hi>Soul, I ſay unto thee, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe.</hi> Do not we ſee oftentimes People viſited with afflictions murmur againſt God, curſing him that afflicted them? Theſe by impatiency being unable to ariſe of themſelves, is it not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that God ſay to the ſoul, <hi>Ariſe:</hi> There is no difference between his ſaying and doing: for what he ſaith he doth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Lord ſay once <hi>Ariſe</hi> to the Soul, ſhe ariſeth, and then he delivereth her to her Mother the Church, which was ſorrowfull for her ſins. In like manner God to raiſe me from my Sins, ſendeth Adverſity, to the end I ſhould acknowledg mine iniquity, and with humility turn unto him, which I cannot do without his Heavenly grace, much leſs atchieve true Felicity
<pb facs="tcp:102717:33"/>and Bleſſedneſs, unleſs he help. Then was I warned by the ſcourges of God; that living Worldling like, and following <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs,</hi> I was not happy, but unhappy, being full of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and infection, tumbling in the mire of all iniquity, from the which I could not withdraw my ſelf, for that the eyes of Reaſon were cloſed up by <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> which afterwards were opened by <hi>Gods grace.</hi> To ſee the pitious Eſtate wherein I was, and the Vnderſtanding which <hi>Folly</hi> bad darkned, made me the wofulleſt wretch in the World; nevertheleſſe when I was whipped with Adverſity, I perceived my knowledg ſomewhat cleared and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo that I found in Conſcience that I had accuſtomed my ſelf greatly to unhoneſt things: and when I ſaw the ſequel, that there was no retiring of my ſelf without <hi>Gods grace,</hi> I lifted mine eyes to Heaven, and wringing my hands, all aſhamed and confounded, I lamented with a loud boyce, and humbling my ſelf before the Face of God, whom I had grievouſly effended, I made my moan, ſaying:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O Lord God, Father and Maker of all things, I am not worthy to lift up mine eyes towards thee, nor to ask pardon for thoſe infinite Sins whereof I confeſs my ſelf guilty. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, O God of all goodneſs, and Father of mercy, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee not to puniſh me in thy great rage, nor to condemn me among the Reprobates: I acknowledge my evill, and crave pardon for my miſdeeds: my former life displeaſeth me great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and my heart quaketh for fear of thy Judgments. O God forſake not thy Creature, which is a ſinner, but aid and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt me with thy Heavenly grace, whereof if I may taſte the Vertue, I ſhall need none other Succour: O grant this, for the glory of thy great Name, and for the love of thy dear Son Jeſus Chriſt, to whom with thee and the holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and glory, for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>As I was thus praying, with a willing mind, ſhedding tears, ſtriking my breaſt, conceiving ſorrow for my Sins, ſuddenly I ſaw a Lady deſcending down from Heaven, ſetting her ſelf before me, faſt by the Bog where I ſtuck faſt. This Lady was of a Marbellous Majeſty, and Wonderfull Courteous; ſhe appeared to me in a Garment of White Satten, a Cloak of blew Damask, imbroydered with Gold. Her face ſhined like
<pb facs="tcp:102717:34"/>the Sun, ſo that I was amazed at ſo ſudden a Viſion, not knowing what ſhe was, yet I took heart a grace ſuppoſing ſome help came from Heaven, to draw me out of the Bog wherein I lay. In the end, with all reverence I made my Petition unto her, ſaying: <hi>O good and gracious Lady, whatſoever thou be, I moſt humbly beſeech thee, if thou canſt, that it would pleaſe thee to help me out of this beaſtly Bog of filthy infection; For nothing is near me but Venemous Serpents, and noyſome Vermine: In the name of God therefore I crave thy help.</hi> To the which my requeſt ſhe anſwered, <hi>O Fool, thou ſeeſt now what reward <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> yieldeth thee for following her: If thou hadſt believed my daughter, thou hadſt not been in this miſery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then I asked her, who was that Daughter of hers: She anſwered, the Gentlewoman which admoniſhed thee, eleven dayes paſt, to leave <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> and to follow her: whom becauſe thou believedſt not, but neglectedſt her Counſell, thou lieſt in this unhappineſſe. By this ſpeech of hers, I knew ſhe was <hi>Gods grace,</hi> and the mother of <hi>Vertue.</hi> Then fell I on my knees, and Weeping, thus I ſaid: <hi>O dear Lady, my curſed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour <hi>Folly</hi> drew me from thy Daughter, and I moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy wretch believed her: which deed of mine grieves me, and now I cry thee mercy, moſt humbly deſiring thee of thy clemency, to deliver me out of this filthy mire to follow thee. For although I deſerve Damnation for my miſdeeds, yet thou being by nature mercifull, wilt ſpare me. Gods grace</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this my Lamentation, of her mercy ſtretched forth a Golden Rod, and commanded me to lay my hands upon it, which when I did, I roſe from my Saddle and ſo was out of the Bog, where I left <hi>Temerity</hi> my Horſe, and <hi>Folly</hi> my Governeſs, to fiſh for Frogs. Thus you ſee that <hi>Gods Grace</hi> draweth us from ſin, without any merit of ours: howbeit not without an inward heart-grief, and ſorrow for ſin, which is a ſpecial gift of <hi>Gods grace.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>WHen I was out of the Bog, humbly on my knees I gave thanks to <hi>Gods grace,</hi> for her goodneſs, being aſſured, that he to whom God doth good is not worthy thereof if he be not thankfull. Then <hi>Gods Grace</hi> marched before me, ſaying that I ſhould follow her, the which I did. For doubtleſs our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will guideth not <hi>Gods Grace,</hi> but <hi>Gods Grace</hi> guideth our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will. Then I followed her, all to be dagled, untill we came where I had ſeen the Palace of Worldly Felicity in greateſt glory, turned into a deep Dungeon of Darkneſs, boyling with conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſire, from whence came a Vile Vapour and ſtinking ſmoak of burning Brimſtone, over the which we muſt paſs by a little long plank, whereat I was ſo afraid, that the hair of my head ſtood an end. Then with ſorrowfull lighes I beſeeched <hi>Gods grace</hi> to tell me what was the light which we ſaw, (queth ſhe) This is the place of thy Voluptuous Palace, with all thy Allies, amongſt whom thou waſt entertained. Mark well, if I had not been thy help, and ſhewed thee mercy, thou hadſt been plagued with them. Think with thy ſelf, if the place be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaut or no. Thou ſeeſt how the Devil handleth thoſe that be here with torments. This is the great King <hi>Lucifer,</hi> whom thou ſuppoſeſt to have ſeen accompanied with ſo many Nobles in the Palace of counterfeit Felicity? theſe be they that fry in the Furnace: here is the reward of ſuch as ſerve him.</p>
                  <p>Then we ſaw a great bed of Iron red hot, wherein lay a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Woman, whom a great dragen imbraced, playing with his Tail between her Legs, with two ligly Serpents winding about her thighs, and eating her privy members. This miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable Woman lamenting, cryed aloud with terrible noyſe. This (quoth <hi>Gods grace</hi>) is the brave Bed wherein thou layeſt, and this Woman is the Goddeſs of Love, which kept thee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Wouldeſt thou be glad now to ſerve her? To which I anſwer, No. Thou ſeeſt (quoth ſhe) this is the end of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
<pb facs="tcp:102717:35"/>livers and wicked Worldlings. Ask them now where are their pleaſures and Voluptuouſneſs. Alas Lady (quoth I) for fear I dare not. Then with a loud Voyce ſhe began, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, asking the queſtion, ſaying: O curſed out caſts of God, and Wretched Worldlings, where are now your fair Chambers, hanged with Silk Lapeſtry, your goodly Gardens, your Dogs of all ſorts, your Birds, your Horſes, your brave Apparel, your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Wives, your change of Meats, your ſweet waters, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Cooks, and Butlers, your Ladies of love, and ſuch like: O unhappy People, the change is great. Inſtead of your Gluttony, you ſuffer hunger; inſtead of your drunkenneſs you ſuffer thirſt; for your ſweet ſmelling you ſuffer ſowre ſavours: inſtead of your leacherous lovers you are accompanied with tormenting Debils, and for your former paſtimes, you endure Terrible puniſhments. When <hi>Gods Grace</hi> had thus ſpoken, that curſed company cryed aloud: Wo be to the hour that ever we were born: the heavy juſtice of God hath deſervedly puniſhed us.</p>
                  <p>This being paſt, <hi>Gods Grace</hi> told me we muſt paſs over that way, notwithſtanding the Plank was narrow and long. Then I, though I were afraid, followed her, ſhe going before me for my ſafety. But I had not gone three ſteps, but I ſaw <hi>Cerberus</hi> the Dog of Hell with his three heads, yelping and gaping to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour me: at which ſight all amazed, my feet ſlipt, and ſtraight he had me by the heels to tear me. Then I cryed to <hi>Gods grace</hi> for help, who looked back, eſpyed me in danger, and hearing me cry, Succour, Succour, ſhe took me up, and in a moment deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me out of the Dungeon: Then I remembred what <hi>David</hi> ſaid: <hi>Si dixiſſem, motus eſt pes meus, miſerecordia tua Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne adjuvabat me; When I ſaid, My feet ſlipped, thy mercy O Lord did help me up.</hi> Now when <hi>Gods grace</hi> carryed me in her arms, I feared my ſilthineſs would hurt her Aray; but I found it contrary, for her Apparel was nothing ſpotted, and mine being foul became fair, which made me much to marbel. Then ſaid <hi>Gods grace;</hi> My Son, like as the Sun ſhineth into the Dyars Dye-fat and yet returneth forth unſpotted: even ſo do I without blotting my ſelf, enter into the ſinfull Soul, and in a moment do make it clean.</p>
                  <p>Then over the High Mountains and ragged Rocks away
<pb facs="tcp:102717:35"/>we Walked, till we came to a croſs way, where <hi>Ventue</hi> wiſhed me to follow her; whoſe ſayings when I called to mind, it made me weep bitterly for my Sins and Follies paſt.

                  </argument>
                  <p>WHen we approached to the School of <hi>Repentance,</hi> which was built upon a high hill, invironed with a Moat, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Humility: Gods grace</hi> called, and out came Lady <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> in plain Apparel, having next her naked Skin a ſmock of Hair-cloath, and upon the ſame a Gown of Sack-cloath, gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded tegether with a great leather Girdle, a Kercher of courſe Canviſe upon her Head.

And whereas before I learned to Leap, Dance, Eat, Drink, Play, hunt Whores, and to do all Villany and Miſchief: new I learned a new Leſſon, namely, to Kneel, to Faſt, to Pray, and to live well, flat contrary to all that I uſed in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Palace of Worldly Felicity. Then <hi>Repentance</hi> ſaid to <hi>Gods grace,</hi> that my Hat full of Feathers, and all things
<pb facs="tcp:102717:36"/>elſe about me muſt be put off, and caſt away. Then <hi>Repentance</hi> began to take off my Toyes, and firſt ſhe hurld my Hat of Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs into the Dungeon, then off went my Girdle of Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, whereunto was tyed my Sword of Rebellion, which being broken in pieces, with my Coat of Vain-glory, my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of lewd Delight, and my Doublet of ill Deſires, all were thrown into the Lake, and there remained only with me my Shirt of Laſciviouſneſs, the which alſo ſhe would have pluckt over mine ears, but I entreated her earneſtly not to leave me naked. So I was for a while excuſed, but not altogether: for ſaid <hi>Repentance,</hi> except thou caſt off all the Apparell of the old Man, thou canſt not come to my Schoole. Then <hi>Repentance</hi> ſaid unto me; Son, thou muſt enter in at this Streight hole, whereout I came. But when I complained, and ſaid, that it was unpoſſible, becauſe my Head would not in, ſhe ſaid there was no other way or entrance into her Schoole. Then I called to mind what our Lord had ſaid in the Goſpel of <hi>Mathew; The way is ſtreight which leadeth to everlaſting life, and very few walk that way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as I ſtood Wondring at the narrow hole, I ſaw an old Serpent enter in, who for lack of room left his Skin behind him, and preſently returned all renewed, and young. Whereat as I marbelled, <hi>Gods Grace</hi> told me, ſaying: Thus thou muſt do. For in entring the Schoole of <hi>Repentance,</hi> thou muſt leave thy old Skin behind thee, and afterwards thou ſhalt return a new Man. This is it which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, ſaying: Put off the old Man, according to the firſt conberſation, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with ill thoughts, and put on the new Man, which is to be created according to God, in juſtice, holineſſe, and truth. The Old Man is the affections of Sin, and the former evill life, which is left behind in the Schoole of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and the new Man is the good life which is newly begun in holineſs and truth. As <hi>Gods grace</hi> was thus teaching me, I ſaw an Old Eagle, heavy-eyed, and thick featherd fluttering aloft: This Eagle falling down, dived three times into a fair fountain thereabouts, and preſently returned young and luſty: which Miracle made me marvail more then that of the Serpent. Then ſaid <hi>Gods grace,</hi> as the Eagle is renewed from the Fountain
<pb facs="tcp:102717:36"/>of water young and luſty, ſo ſhalt thou, after thou comeſt to Chriſt with ſorrow for thy ſin, and conſeſſion of the ſame, which if thou do, thou ſhalt receive thy firſt innocency, which I gave thee in thy Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Gods grace</hi> entred into the Schoole of <hi>Repentance</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, ſaying, I will draw thee in, for it is none but I that ſheweth Sinners the way of <hi>Repentance.</hi> With that ſhe pluckt me in, and ſorthwith I became an enemy to Sin. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let no Man glorine himſelf, ſeeing it is <hi>Gods Grace</hi> that goeth before Mans will, and that by its means is made good. Then I eutring in after, and being a little way in, the paſſage waxed wider, <hi>Gods grace</hi> plucking me in by the head, and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> thruſting at my feet. So then in paſſing in at the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row place, I left <hi>Laſciviouſneſs</hi> my Shirt behind me, torne in pieces, which ſhe hurled into the Dungeon, and all my body was ſcratched. Thus doth <hi>Repentance</hi> prepare her Scholars, for if any mouth will conſeſs his former ſins, not having inward ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and heart-grief for offending God, and full purpoſe to amend his life, he is greatly deceived. For thinking to have Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, he ſhall be ſure of curſing. But to my purpoſe; <hi>Repentance</hi> put on my naked body ſuch Apparel as ſhe her ſelf did wear; which when I ſaw, I thought upon the Apoſtles; not that I thought my ſelf as good as they, but hoping to come (by <hi>Gods grace</hi>) to the place where they are, I was well content to do as they did.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>How true Repentance begins in us, and how the Knights con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience accuſed him, what pains he had deſerved.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT is true, that Repentance (as it ought) cannot be done without ſpecial grace from God. For the heart of ſinfull men cannot change her diſordinate life nor turn from their offences, nor prepare themſelves to God, without the fingular operation of <hi>Gods grace.</hi> The Doctors diſpute daily, whether true <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> taketh her beginning at love, or at ſear. This queſtion cannot be decided in few words: but to be ſhort, I ſay it may begin at both. For true <hi>Repentance</hi> being a work of God, he
<pb facs="tcp:102717:37"/>may bring it as he liſt. But when it comes from love, it is not ordinary or common, but Marvellous. Look upon the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> of Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> and the Thiefe. But or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily God begins <hi>Repentance</hi> in us by fear, as in the third Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> when be commanded <hi>Elias</hi> to come out of his Cave to remain in the Mount before the Lord, and a mighty ſtrong Wind paſſed by, and rent the high Hills and ragged Rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the Wind: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that came an Earth-quake, but the Lord was not in the Earth-quake: After that came a Fire, but the Lord was not in the Fire: After that came a ſoft Wind, wherein the Lord was. In ſuch ſort, Gods ſends to Sinners, a Wind of Terrour, to break the mighty Mountain of Pride, and the heart more hard than the Rock: after that comes the troubling of the Soul, after that comes the Conſcience, grudging the heart of the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and accuſing him of his evill Life: but yet the Lord is not there with his quickning grace: Nevertheleſe, theſe be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners to prepare the way of the Lord. For when the perverſe Will of Man is mortified by ſervile fear, and led almoſt to Hell; after comes the ſweet ſound of <hi>Gods grace,</hi> which reviveth the Soul, ſaying: <hi>Lazarus come forth.</hi> This is the voice that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Conſolation, at the hearing whereof we may be bold to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in peace, with aſſurance of remiſſion of our ſins. But it ſeems that <hi>Repentance</hi> began firſt in the Knight at Love, and that miraculouſly: for he being in the Filth of Sin, ſuddenly by Gods Providence confeſſed his folly, and loathing his lewd life, he required help and ſuccour at <hi>Gods grace,</hi> who preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſted him, and brought him out of the ſink of ſin. But this manner of converſion is not ordinarily uſed.</p>
                  <p>There are indeed certain fore-runners to the juſtifying of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which prepare the way to Gods reviving or quickning grace, and offereth unto God a renewed Spirit, and a pure and upright heart; which manner of converſion Godly People only do uſe. And hereof meaneth the Knight to ſpeak, purpoſing alſo to ſhew how it digreſſeth from <hi>Gods grace.</hi> When <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> had thus apparelled me with Hair and Sack-cloath, I was ſet upon a Stoole, and then <hi>Gods grace</hi> appeared unto me with two Women and one Man, which was a Preacher. Now
<pb facs="tcp:102717:37"/>one of the Women held in her right hand a ſharp pricking I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron rod (called the gnawing of the Conſcience;) in her leſt hand ſhe had a red Book, whereat I was afraid. For as ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held me, me thought ſhe threatned me. The other Woman was Courteous and Milde and gentle, holding in her right hand a Book of Gold, covered with Pearls, and ſhe was called <hi>Remembrance. Gods grace</hi> placed Conſcience on my left hand, and <hi>Remembrance</hi> on my right hand, the Preacher, <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and the Damſels about me, and then commanded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to open the red Book, which when I perceived, and ſaw the Words Written with blood, declaring all my offences, with Torments unto them belonging, for my following of <hi>Folly,</hi> I was amazed and became ſpeechleſs. Then Conſcience with her Iron rod teucht me, prickt me, yea, pierced my heart, and cryed aloud unto me, ſaying: Behold thou Wretch, view this Book, and thou ſhalt ſee how thou haſt lived, even againſt God, and contrary to right and reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Thou haſt been Proud, Arrogant, ambitious, ſpitefull at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers proſperity, a prolonger of time, Wrathfull, a Backbiter, injurious, Trayterous, hatefull, Covetous of Gold more than of God, Gluttouous, Wanton, Shameleſs, a ſtewes-hunter, given to all vices, and haſt tranſgreſſed all the commandements of God, leading a loathſome life, denying God, ſwearing, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his name, an haynous effender, a falſe Witneſs bearer, a lyar, a deſirer of other Mens goods, diſobedient to Parents, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, and wiſhing their death. Furthermore, thou hadſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher Faith nor hope in God, but rather in the force, riches, hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and friendſhip, of thy kindred, with their Authority. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reckon up the reſt of thy Sins, for they are uncountable. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little care haſt thou had of Chriſts merits, or of thy own ſouls health, but alwayes yielding to <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> filthineſs, and iniquity. When Conſcience had thus accuſed me, <hi>Sorow for Sin</hi> ſell bitterly aweeping, and oftentimes ſtruck her breaſt. Then Conſcience ſhewed me what Torments I had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for following Voluptuous affections, and for loving them better then God. Thou oughteſt, ſaid ſhe, to burn in Hell fire that never quencheth, and to be nipped with Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both of Body and Soul for evermore. Thy laughing
<pb facs="tcp:102717:38"/>ſhall be turned to Weeping, the Ioy to Sorrow, thy Songs to Cries: yea, what pains can be named, but thou art like perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to ſuffer them, without hope of Redemption? For this is the due reward of Worldly Felicity, and following <hi>Folly.</hi> Be think thee now, and tell me if it be in thy power to rid thee from theſe grievances: Hearing my Conſcience thus ſpeak, me thought I ſaw Hell open to ſwallow me up, and with ſorrowfull ſadneſs I fell to the ground, before <hi>Gods grace</hi> ſpeechleſs: but ſhe had Compaſſion on me, and bade me ariſe; the which I did, though half in deſpair; and to re-comfort me, ſhe opened the book which <hi>Remembrance</hi> held in her hand.</p>

Then at the commandment of <hi>Gods grace, remembrance</hi> read out of that book unto me in this manner; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſaith; <hi>Where Sin hath abounded, grace hath more abounded.</hi> He that miſtruſteth the mercy of God, miſtruſteth God to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and in ſo doing he doth God great diſhonour. For he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth God to be <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> wherein conſiſteth all the hope of poor Sinners. For of his great love, he ſent his only Son to take Mans Nature upon him in this World, that in the ſame he might ſuffer death upon the Croſs, for the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins. Conſequently he promiſed for the love of his Son, Remiſſion and Pardon to all Poor Sinners, ſo often as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it in Faith, with an heavy and ſorrowfull Heart. Now God is as true of his Promiſes, as he is of Power able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them. And as he is of Power, ſo will he do whatſoever pleaſeth him; God will pardon Sinners their Sins; who then can let him from doing it? To whom God pleaſeth or hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb facs="tcp:102717:38"/>to pardon their Sins, he forgiveth. The truth hereof is Written in plain Words, and ſhewed by examples in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the holy Scripture, as well in the Old Teſtament as the New. Firſt, <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith: <hi>It is I my ſelf, It is I my ſelf, that doth blot out thine iniquities, for mine own love ſake, and I will not have thy ſins in remembrance.</hi> For the love of me (ſaith he) and not for the love of thee, meaning his goodneſs and mercy, and not for the love of thy merits. As if he had ſaid to all ſinners in this ſort; If thou thinkeſt that I pardon thy Sins for thy merits ſake, thou art deceived, and Walloweſt in deſpair; no, no, but for my mercy and infinite goodneſs, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and forgive. Thou haſt no cauſe to deſpair, for the leaſt part of my mercy exceedeth all thy Sins. In another place he ſaith by the ſame Prophet: <hi>Turn your ſelves unto me all the Earth, and you ſhall be ſaved, for I am God, and there is none other beſides me.</hi> What is the meaning of theſe Words, <hi>I am God,</hi> any thing elſe, but that God is good and mercifull? If it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but he ſhould be God, it is unpoſſible but he ſhould be good and mercifull.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Prophet ſpeaketh unto every one of us, ſaying: <hi>Let the Infidell leave his wayes, and the unjuſt Man his thoughts, let them turn to the Lord, and he will have pitty upon him, for he is ready to forgive.</hi> And by the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi> he ſaith to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he was wroth for their Idolatry, and many other Sins, nevertheleſs he ſaid, <hi>Turn <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thou Rebell, unto me thy Lord, and I will not turn my face from thee;</hi> or as the Hebrew Text ſaith, <hi>I will not lay mine ire upon thee; for I am</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>holy and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and keep not mine anger for ever.</hi> And by the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> he ſaith, <hi>If the evill Man repent him of his Sins, and keep my Commandements, doing righteouſly, he ſhall live and not dye: neither will I have his former offences any more in remembrance. Do you think</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the death of a Sinner? nay, rather that he ſhould turn from his Wickedneſs and live.</hi> Repent you then, and you ſhall live. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaid: <hi>That from morning till night <hi>Iſrael</hi> hoped in the Lord:</hi> what doth this ſignifie, but that the faithfull from their Nativity and Birth, untill their very Death, have hope in the Lord?</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:102717:39"/>
                  <p>There is mercy in the Lord, and great Redemption atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth upon him. In <hi>Joel</hi> it is Written: <hi>Turn your ſelves unto the Lord, with all your heart, in Faſting, Praying, Weeping, Sorrow, tearing your hearts and not your Garments, ſo ſhall you be turned unto the Lord your God, for he is full of Clemency, Mercy, and Grace, ſlow to ire, and ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give;</hi> or (as the Hebrew Text ſaith) <hi>ſuch a one as repents him of evill,</hi> that is to ſay, is leath to execute the puniſhment upon Sinners, which he hath denounced and threatned. <hi>Micheas</hi> the Prophet ſaith: <hi>What God is there like unto thee, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt away iniquities and forgiveſt Sins, for the reſt of thine Heritage ſake?</hi> He keepeth not his ire for ever, but of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and mercy will have pitty upon us. He will put out our iniquities, and throw all our Sins into the bottom of the Sea. What Sinner is there that hearing theſe words, hath ſo heavy a heart as to deſpair, ſeeing that God is more ready to forgive, than the Sinner is to ask forgiveneſs?</p>
                  <p>Now let us come to the New Teſtament, to try if there be not Teſtimenies to the ſame effect: The Son of God, which is the infallible Truth, ſpake thus to <hi>Nicodemus: God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, to the end that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould be ſaved and not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> God ſent not his Son into the World to condemn the World, but to the end the World ſhould be ſaved by him. To the Scrives and Phariſies which murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red becauſe he did eat and drink among Publicans and Sinners, Chriſt ſaid: <hi>Thoſe that be whole need not the Phyſitian, but ſuch as be ſick.</hi> Again, <hi>I came not</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>to call the juſt, but Sinners to repentance.</hi> Not as a Iudge, but as a Phyſitian: for ſuch as languiſh in their Sins came I into the World, not that they ſhould remain Sinners, but to turn them from their Sins, that being Penitent they might be made righteous: Likewiſe he told the Phariſees, that the Angels in Heaven do more rejoyce in one penitent Sinner than in <hi>99</hi> juſt perſons, which need no repentance. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>ſpared not his only Son, but gave him that he ſhould rather dye for us, than we be unpardoned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If God ſpared not his only Son to dye for Sinners, what
<pb facs="tcp:102717:39"/>thing is more precious unto him, that he ſhould reſuſe to give them? And therefore the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaking or Ieſus Chriſt, ſaith thus: <hi>We have not an high Prieſt which cannot have Compaſſion of our Infirmities, but ſuch a one as in all points was tempted as well as we, Sin excepted.</hi> Let us go then boldly to the Seat of Grace, that we may obtain merry and find grace in time convenient. If I ſhould rehearſe all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Scripture to this effect, the ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">

                     </gap>e would fail me. Thus we ſee then, none hath cauſe to diſtruſt the goodneſs of God, or to deſpair becauſe of the greatneſs of his Sins, ſeeing that God hath made ſo many fair promiſes to pardon the Penitent Sinner: there be many Examples in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the performance of Gods promiſes, as namely to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> who commitred bath Adultery and Murther, he, even he, by ſorrowing for his offences, and crying <hi>Peccavi,</hi> obtained mercy and pardon of all his Wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Manaſſes</hi> the Son of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſet up the falſe worſhip of God, which his Father had defaced, and of an evill zeal to infidelity, he himſelf offered up his own Children in fire for Sacrifice. He perſecuted the Prophets, and ſine innumerable Innocents; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all which, he cauſed the prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> to be ſawn in pieces. In the end he was taken by his Enemies, and led Captive into <hi>Babylon:</hi> but when he was in his extreamity, he acknowledged his offence, and asked forgiveneſs of God, by whom he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to favour, and reſtored to his Kingdom again.</p>
                  <p>The People of <hi>Ninive,</hi> whom God threatned by the Prophet <hi>Jonas,</hi> utterly to deſtroy, for the multitude of their Sins, they repented and prayed, and ſo God forgave them. The <hi>Samaritane</hi> alſo and the <hi>Canaanite,</hi> notwithſtanding their horrible ſins, when they asked Gods mercy, he forgave them; <hi>Matthew, Zacheus,</hi> and divers other Publicans, upon their repentance were received into favour. <hi>Peter</hi> that denyed his Maſter (our Lord Ieſus Chriſt) three times ſwearing that he knew him not, when he wept vitterly for his Sins, he was received into mercy. The Thief alſo upon the Croſs, being at the paint of Death, even this Fellow who lived upon nothing but Robbery and Man ſlaughter all his life time, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hainous Sins, asked pardon, and God forgave him; yea,
<pb facs="tcp:102717:40"/>he obtained more than he required: for Chriſt ſaid unto him, <hi>This day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> This is Gods property, even to give of his Liverality more than Men do or can ask. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was a Blaſphemer, and a Perſecuter of Gods Church, and yet he received mercy. God hath ſet down ſuch Perſons as Examples for Sinners, to the end they ſhould not doubt of his Mercy: and to teach them that he doth not Pardon offences, for the merits of the Sinners, which are ſtark Naught, even when they are beſt, but for his mercies ſake, which is adove all his Works. For ſo to imagine of Mens merits is Deſtruction; if any thing be aſcribed unto merits, then to the merits of his Son Ieſus Chriſt, and for his bitter Paſſion ſake. Let this be the concluſion, that albeit the Sinner hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as many Sins as there be drops of Water in the Sea, or Sands on the Sea ſhore, yet he hath no cauſe to deſpair, for though they be never ſo monſtrous and manifold, yet the mercy of God doth infinitely exceed them. For his mercy conſumes them ſooner, than the fire doth durn up the dry Ton. When I heard Lady <hi>Remembrance</hi> read theſe words, I took heart a grace, and recited a place Written in the Pſalmes of <hi>David, According to the multitude of the grief and ſorrowes of my heart, thy conſolations have refreſhed my Soul.</hi> And then falling on my knees, holding up my hands, with ſorrowfull Countenance and Compunction of Heart, reſting wholly upon the mercies and promiſes of God, and the merits of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, I moſt humbly deſired pardon for my Sins, at the hands of <hi>Gods grace.</hi> Vpon which unfained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of mine offences, and heart-grief, hand-maids of perfect <hi>Repentance,</hi> and fore-runners to the purpoſe, I received by the means of <hi>Gods grace,</hi> the benefit of the death and Paſſion of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt; to whom with the Father and the holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and Glory for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>IN the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Amen.</hi> The great goodneſs and unſpeakable mercy which hath been uſed in all Ages and times, of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt towards all poor Sinners, are in many places of the Goſpel made maniteſt, and clearly notified: but chieſty in the ſeventh of <hi>Luke.</hi> Wherein mention is made of a ſinfull Woman, lewd of Life, and of ill name, contemned, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, and abhorred of Men, whom ſweet Ieſus did not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to Favour, but alſo by inward and ſecret inſpiration drew her to <hi>repentance:</hi> how, and in what ſort, hear and underſtand.</p>
                  <p>The Goſpel ſaith, that there was a Phariſie, furniſhed with falſe Faith, and nuzled with a vain Opinion of holineſs: he was a great Doctor of the Law, and a renowned Iuſticiary; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit weak in Faith, and yet very high minded. When our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had one day preached and inſtructed the People, by his Divine and holy Doctrine, exhorting poor Sinners to turn to God by <hi>repentance,</hi> and uttering many Parables and Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, as the Prodigal Child, the loſt Sheep, and ſuch like, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he doth declare and ſignifie, that he is inclined to compaſſion, ready to have mercy, and to receive into ſavour all repentant Sinners: the proud Phariſie prayed him to come into his Houſe, and to dine with him. The good Lord which had taken upon Him Mans Nature, and was born for the Salvation of all, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed not his proud fellowes requeſt, neither reſuſed to enter into his Houſe, although he was ambitious, but down at the Table ſate the Son of God, made Man for the Salvation of Men. He was conberſant among Men, he did eat and drink with Men, he offered himſelf a helper to every one, ſhewing unto all his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, without exception of any. Now he being ſet at the Table, there came one unto him in ſhape like a Woman, but in courage a Man, who by the brute of the whole City was counted a great Sinner, and very ill-reported of the World, and ſuch a one
<pb facs="tcp:102717:41"/>indeed as every Body mocked and pointed at with their fingers. But yet in the ſight of God ſhe was in great honour, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was an hainous Sinner, but becauſe ſhe was Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated and elected of God, from the beginning, to raign with him in his Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>This Woman hearing by report the renown of our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and that he ſhewed himſelf ſweet and bountifull to all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, defending them againſt the malicious ſlanders and mocks of the proud and arregant Phariſies, and promiſing to every one that believed in him, the Kingdom of Heaven: this Woman was inſpired both outwardly and inwardly by our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus Chriſt, to ſee and hear him preach. Then did ſhe by outward ſpeech expreſs, how ſhe was inwardly affected and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in mind, and ſeeing her Soul ſore ſick and diſeaſed, her heart full of iniquity and ſin, her Conſcience defiled with all kind of vice, her ſelf fruſtrate and void of all hope of health, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing how to recover this malady addreſſed her ſelf to ſeek him who is the only Phyſitian of all ſick Souls, ſhe ſought for grace at the Well of Mercy, and though ſhe was a ſhamefull Sinner, yet was ſhe received of him, which came into the World to ſave Sinners. She came not pompouſly arrayed, nor yet came with a train, ſhe came alone and not empty handed: for ſhe brought with her a Box full of moſt precious Ointment, of a ſweet ſmell, repreſenting the <hi>Faith, Hope, and Charity,</hi> lodged in her heart.</p>
                  <p>What could this be but the ſweet ſmell of Vertue? For what repreſents the Box of Alablaſter-ſtone, but holy Faith, founded upon the true Corner-ſtone, Ieſus Chriſt, wherein is conſerved all Vertues, and without which it is unpoſſible to pleaſe God? Came ſhe alone, being accompanied with <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity, Humility,</hi> and <hi>Repentance?</hi> She entred the Houſe uncalled, where was her Phyſitian, and putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part all ſhame, which might hinder her, together with the mocks of the proud Phariſies, which ſate at the Table, ſhe cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Comfort and Health for her ſick Soul, acknowledging her griefe, and that being certain he to whom ſhe came, had power to help her. Vnto this Phyſitian ſhe could not have come without Faith; ſhe was not ſo bold and hardy as to look Ieſus in the
<pb facs="tcp:102717:41"/>Face, but ſell at his ſeet upon Her knees ſementably Weeping, and with the flood of Her Hears waſhing his ſeet, and wiping and drying them with Her hairy locks; then ſhe kiſſed them, and with her Precious Oyntment ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

Her body which afore-time was given to delights is now aſiſicted with Faſting: Her lauging is turned into weeping: and as Her firſt life was wholly bent to pleaſe the World, ſo now it is more behemently and earneſtly diſpoſed to pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p>With Her fair flaxen Hair, which ſhe was wont to keep dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, ſhe hath dryed our Saviours Feet: her ſweet lips, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe uſed to kiſſe her Lovers, hath kiſſed his feet: Her Odoriferous Oyntment, wherewith ſhe beautified Her face in wantonneſs, hath anointed our Saviours feet: Now all this was a ſure fign of <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> And thus you ſee how we ought to repent. Surely we ſhould do according to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, which is, that our Members which have conſented to commit iniquity ſhould be offered unto the Lord, as Inſtruments of righteouſneſs, to receive ſanctification. As for example, to make the matter more manifeſt: Haſt thou been a Drunkard? Become now Sober. Haſt thou keen a Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton? Now faſt. Haſt thou been proud? Be now humble. Haſt thou been Coverous? Now gives Alms. Haſt thou been wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? Be now gentle. Haſt thou been envious? Be now chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Haſt thou been Traiterous? Be now Faithfull. Haſt thou been Leacherous? Be now Chaſt. Haſt thou been blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous? Be now fearfull to ſpeak any thing but Truth. And ſo conſequently to every Vile Vice lay a meet medicine,
<pb facs="tcp:102717:42"/>which may ſerve for thy ſickneſs, and expel the poyſon of ſin.</p>
                  <p>But now let us ſee what may be thought and judged of this Phariſie, who ſo ſaucily beſought our Lord and Saviour to come into his Houſe. Surely he ſeemed, as he was, a Vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hypocrite. For when he ſaw the Wofull Woman faln at the feet of our Saviour, with her Tears waſhing them, with her hair Wiping them, with her mouth kiſſing them, and with her Precious Ointment anoynting them, he blamed not only her in his heart, but alſo our Lord for ſuffering her. Then the Lord took the ſick Woman, healed her of her ſickneſs in the preſence of this proud Phariſie, and with-held Phyſick from him, whoſe Heart was wounded to the death with the dart of Vain-glory: then he ſhewed himſelf frantick, and as one that had loſt his underſtanding, not knowing his griefe, nor what Medicine would do him good: But what ſaid he in his fooliſh Heart: If this Man (quoth he) were a Prophet, he would quickly know what Woman this is that toucheth him? for ſhe is a great Sinner.</p>
                  <p>This Phariſie is of the race of the Vain-glorious of whom the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh in their perſon ſaying; Come not near me, for I am clear: or as another Tranſlation ſaith; Get thee hence and meddle not with me, for I am holier then thou. Even ſo ſurely it is not unlike if the Woman had come near the Phariſie, he would have uſed theſe words, and have ſaid, Stand back, and touch me not, for I am holy, but thou art known for a hainous Sinner. Certainly, true righteouſneſs and holineſſe hath compaſſion upon poor Sinners, whereas on the contrary, falſe righteouſneſs and Hypocriſie hath them in Hatred and Diſdain. But let us liſten with what ſentence this ſond Phariſie was convicted, and reproved by our Saviour, to be worſe then this ſinfull Woman. The Lord then to ſhew that he was not only a Prophet, but alſo the Lord and God of Prophets, anſwered the thought of the Proud Phariſie, ſaying, <hi>Simon,</hi> I have ſomewhat to tell thee. Then ſaid he, Speak on Maſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Creditor</hi> (quoth the Lord) <hi>had two Debtors; whereof the one ow'd him 500 pence, the other but 50; now they both having nothing to pay, the Creditor forgives them the Debt.
<pb facs="tcp:102717:42"/>Now tell me which of thoſe Debtors loveth the Creditor moſt?</hi> Simon <hi>ſaid, I think he to whom moſt was forgiven; Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus anſwered. Thou haſt rightly ſpoken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Lord in propounding this Queſtion, defired alſo to heal this Phariſie. For if he had denyed it, Ieſus would have eaten none of his meat. Theſe two Debtors were <hi>Simon</hi> and the ſinfull Woman. The ſinfull Woman not only by the Iudgment of the ſtanders by, but alſo by her own confeſſion acknowledged her ſelf more indebted then <hi>Simon,</hi> and <hi>Simon</hi> leſs indebted then ſhe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought himſelf righteous in reſpect of her. The Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor is our Lord God, who lends and gives us his gilts, both temporal and ſpiritual, to intereſt, disburſing to one five Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, to another two, and to another one. Now then is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the judgment of <hi>Simon,</hi> that the Woman was moſt in debt to God, unto whom he forgave moſt. And becauſe ſhe loved God better then <hi>Simon</hi> did, ſhe deſerved again of him to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beloved, in that ſhe did more good ſervice to God, then <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> did, notwithſtanding his meat.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Lord valued the love and good Will of this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and preferred it before <hi>Simons,</hi> reprehending him of his arrogancy, and ſaying: <hi>Doſt thou ſeeſt this Woman, whom thou judgeſt more in debt then thy ſelf? I entred into thy Houſe, and thou haſt not given me water to waſh my feet, but ſhe hath waſhed them with tears, and wip'd them with her hair, though Water was eaſier to be found then tears; Thou haſt not kiſt my mouth, but ſhe hath kiſt my feet. Thou haſt not annointed my head with common Oyl, but ſhe hath annointed my feet with fine Oyntment. So that by theſe ſignes thou ſeeſt that ſhe loves me better then thou doſt. Therefore I tell thee, that many Sins are forgiven her, becauſe ſhe loved much. For to him is leaſt forgiven, that hath leaſt loved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord ſaid this to beat down the proud opinion of the fond Phariſie, not that he was but little forgiven, but becauſe <hi>Simon</hi> might know that he thought ſo. For truly as who ſo commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth moſt Sins, is moſt indebted to God: ſo likewiſe is he that hath leaſt offended. To conclude, both the leſs and the great ſtand in need of <hi>Gods Grace:</hi> unto whom they cannot come of their own ſtrength and vertue. As the greateſt Sinner reſerreth to
<pb facs="tcp:102717:43"/>God the remiſſion of his fins: even ſo ought the juſteſt man to do alſo. For there is no ſin which one Man committeth, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would commit the like, if God, who made Man without ſin, did not keep him from ſin, as witneſſeth Saint <hi>Auſten.</hi> But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance one will ſay, I have not committed Adultery as this man hath. To whom I anſwer, thou haſt not had ſuch occaſion mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred as he hath had: and he hath not had the Grace to avoid it as thou haſt had. It was Gods doing, and no Will of thine, if thou haſt had no occaſion nor convenient time, nor fit opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to fall into that Sin. Suppoſe thou haſt had occaſion offered, with opportunity and all things fit, and yet haſt reſrained: Well, it is God then that guided and governed thee, that thou ſhouldeſt not do it. Acknowledge then the grace of God, as thou art bound, becauſe thou haſt not committed ſuch a ſin. For as he who hath committed moſt ſins, is moſt indebted to God: even ſo is he who never finued, Gods debter: for were not the grace of God his Guide, he would do enough. Now to our purpoſe. After the Lord had convinced the Phariſie of his proud Opinion, to comfort the ſorrowfull Woman lying at his feet, he ſaid thus: <hi>Woman thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> O joyfull voice, O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Woman, that art worthy to hear the Son of God ſpeak to thee, and forgive thee thy Sins. But thoſe comfortable words of the Lord greatly offended the proud Phariſies at the Feaſt, who turned them to Blaſphemy, ſaying: What Fellow is this that alſo forgiveth Sinners? It is apparent enough that he is a Blaſphemer: for to pardon and forgive Sinners belongeth only to God.</p>
                  <p>No doubt our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was taken to be a very poor man, of him that requeſted him to Dinner, and of thoſe which were at the Table. It was known that man could not forgive ſins, but they believed not that Ieſus Chriſt was God, and therefore ſay they: What Fellow is this, that forgiveth ſins? Theſe Feaſters were ſick of a deadly diſeaſe, which they neither knew, nor yet the remedy to heal and do them good. Is it not a Madneſs, that ſuch as are Sick ſhould fall a laughing at them that are ſound and in good Health? So did the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies laugh at Ieſus Chriſt, and the Woman, who were not ſick: or if ſhe were ſick, ſhe acknowledged her Sickneſſe, and
<pb facs="tcp:102717:43"/>ſought help of the Phyſitian. It is moſt true that Man cannot forgive Sins, but this Woman which believed that Chriſt could forgive Sins, believed alſo that he was God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore able to forgive Sins.</p>
                  <p>But why did not our Saviour Chriſt anſwer theſe murmuring Phariſies, and ſay: I am the Son of God, when they asked the queſtion, ſaying: what Fellow is this that forgiveth Sins? No, he let them murmure, and turned himſelf towards the Woman, and ſaid: Thy Faith hath ſaved thee, depart in Peace. Though ſhe heard him ſay of the Phariſies, theſe men murmure, and eſteem me as it pleaſeth them, nevertheleſs be thou aſſured that thy Faith hath ſaved thee, and therefore depart in peace, and enjoy full reſt and tranquility of conſcience, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a lively Faith, and fulfilled with Love. Let all ſick ſouls that are laden with Sins, if they will be healed, let them (I ſay) come in Faith and aſſured Hope to the true Phyſitian of ſouls, which is Ieſus Chriſt; let them confeſs their offences with ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">

Let your ſuperfluous riches be given among the poor, and not ſpent in Feaſting, and Pompous Apparell. And after that the Sinner with love and liverality hath thought upon the poor, helping them in their need, as well with good counſell, as with Alms-deeds, and living as the Rule of Gods Word requireth, he ſhall receive peace and quietneſs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and he reconciled to God the Father, for the merits of his Deer Son Ieſus Chriſt, to whom be all Honour and Glory, for ever and ever.

                     <p>The Knight having heard the ſermon, received the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and dinner being ended, mounted into a Chariot, and was (by Gods grace) carried to the Palace of Vertue.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>GReat was the comfort I took by the ſermon of the good Hermit, wherefore I was deſirous to know his Name, the which I asked Lady <hi>Memory,</hi> who told me that
<pb facs="tcp:102717:44"/>it was good <hi>Underſtanding.</hi> Then I received the holy Communion, which being ended, and Thanks given to God, I meant to ſalute gratiſie him. But before we went to receive the holy Sacrament of the body and blood of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Ieſus Chriſt, I remembred the great love of our Lord, which humbly took upon him our fraile and weak nature, for our ſakes became accurſed, and ſuffered moſt bitter death upon the Croſs, to deliver us out of the bandage of Sin, Hell, and Eternal death, and to bring us to everlaſting life. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred alſo that love which he ſhewed unto me in drawing me out of the ſink of ſin, wherein I was plunged over head and ears: ſo that I was not only drawn from my unſpeakable ſins, but alſo made a Communicant of the myſtery of his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, by faith. And to the end it might pleaſe him to give me grace to receive it aright, I prayed unto him on this wiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O Sweet Jeſus, and loving Redeemer, I yield thee thanks for thy unſpeakable love, by which thou haſt purged me from the filth of ſin, and pluckt me by thy grace out of the dark dungeon of death. Behold, I reconcile my ſelf unto thee, moſt heartily beſeeching thee that thou wouldeſt vouchſafe (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the great number of thy benefits) of thy great liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to give me grace to be a faithfull partaker of thy preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body and blood, repreſented unto me under the viſible form of Bread and Wine. O immortal King, I am not worthy, I confeſs, of ſo great a benefit: yet I beſeech thee, as thou doſt make the unworthy worthy, and the ſinners juſt, ſo make me worthy to receive this holy, bleſſed, and Heavenly Sacrament, to my Souls Health. Feed my Soul, O Lord, with thy ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Body, and let thy blood revive and quicken my Spirit. O make me (by thy grace daily encreaſing in me) a member of thy myſticall body, that I may be included within the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and bleſſing which thou madeſt with thy Saints and Apoſtles in thy laſt Supper; communicating unto them the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament of thy body and Blood: and conſequently that I may be of the number of them which according to the Vow and Promiſe made in Baptiſm, do live in Faith, and by thy grace are received into the company of Saints. Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:102717:44"/>
                  <p>This prayer being ended, with all Reverence and Devotion I received the holy <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and that being ended, we went from the Chappel into a great Hall, where I met the good Hermit <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> whom when I had ſaluted, and he me, I thanked him for his good <hi>ſermon.</hi> Then as we were talking, <hi>Gods Grace</hi> ſaid unto me, Sir Knight, I give thee for thy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour this good Hermit <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> believe his Counſel, and do what he commands. Then I remembred my old Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Folly,</hi> whom I left in the bog amongſt Serpents and Toads; ſo I was very glad of my Governour, and give thanks to <hi>Gods Grace:</hi> who from the Table gave me drugs to eat, and repeated unto me a place written in the <hi>80</hi> Pſalme of <hi>David, Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then having ſwallowed that which ſhe gave me, I forgat the World, and made no reckoning of any thing therein. For all my deſire was in haſte to ſee the Palace of true <hi>Felicity.</hi> I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red death, to be with Chriſt in Heaven. Dinner being done, the Gates of <hi>Repentance</hi> were opened which were narrow: contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, as it appeareth in the firſt Book, that the entrance into the Palace of <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> was wide, large, and great, but the end thereof was deſperation, and deſtruction: as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, the entring into the Palace of <hi>Repentance</hi> is ſtreight and narrow, but the end thereof is eternal Life. For <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) leadeth the Repentant to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Salvation. When the gates were open, I mounted up into a Chariot of Ivory, having golden wheels, and two white Horſes with wings drawing the ſame. <hi>Gods Grace</hi> gat up firſt, and with her hand helped me up, then followed the good Hermit <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> then <hi>Memory, Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> but <hi>Gods Grace</hi> governed all, who touching the Horſes with her Rod, they mounted up over the Mountains which are above the Earth. So we paſſed through the Region of the Air, where inhabiteth all the wicked ſpirits, which watch to annoy ſuch as would mount up to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And though I was greatly agaſt hereat, yet my truſt was in <hi>Gods Grace,</hi> under whoſe Wings I hid my ſelf. I truſted not in my <hi>Conſcience,</hi> although it was at peace, nor to <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> nor to <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> but to <hi>Gods Grace</hi> only, who ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:102717:45"/>throwded me under her Wings, as the Hen doth her Chickens againſt the coming of the Kite. Then ſhe commanded the wicked Enemies to get them hence, and they forthwith ſled away, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloud: Now have we loſt our Knight: lo, he is mounted up to the Palace of <hi>Vertue,</hi> in deſpight of us all: Now he is eſcaped under the Wings of <hi>Gods grace.</hi> Being paſt this brunt, I heartily thanked <hi>Gods grace</hi> of her goodneſs, and on the ſudden I ſaw upon the top of a Mountain a goodly Palace. Now for that love ingendreth tamiliarity, and familiarity breeds boldneſs, I asked <hi>Gods grace,</hi> what place it was: and ſhe told me it was the Palace of <hi>Vertue.</hi> It was ſo high that it reached even to Heaven, and about it were ſeven ſair Towers of Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaſter. In the firſt dwelt <hi>Faith,</hi> in the ſecond <hi>Hope,</hi> in the third <hi>Charity,</hi> in the fourth <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> in the fifth <hi>Juſtice,</hi> in the ſixth <hi>Fortitude,</hi> and in the ſeventh <hi>Temperance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt Tower, <hi>Gods grace</hi> ſhewed me <hi>Faith,</hi> which waited for our coming, near unto whom I might perceive the Palace of true <hi>Felicity.</hi> With that I deſired Lady <hi>Memory</hi> to put me in mind in the morning of ſeeing that gallant City. Whiles we talked thus, our Chariot arrived at the Court, where Lady <hi>Vertue</hi> with her Daughters, <hi>Faith, Hope, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Wiſdome, Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Temperance</hi> dwelt. At the firſt ſight I knew it was the ſame Lady <hi>Vertue</hi> which afore-time had ſo well admoniſhed me, to whom I gave no ear. Then reverently upon my knees lamenting, I cryed her mercy for contemning her Counſell, and following <hi>Voluptuouſneſs.</hi> Wherewith ſhe made me ariſe, and in token that ſhe took in good part my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, ſhe ſweetly kiſſed me, and bade me Welcome.

                     <p>The Knight declareth the great good, the ſolace, and the pleaſure which he found in the Palace of Lady Vertue.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IF I had a thouſand tongues to tell the truth of all the good and pleaſures which I found in the Palace of <hi>Vertue:</hi> and if I live a thouſand years to report this matter, all were too little, in every point to decipher it: for it conſiſteth not in Angelical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, much leſs in mans wit, wholly to comprehend ſo noble a myſtery: none knows it but he who hath proved it: you may be ſure that there are not, as in the Palace of Worldly pleaſure chambers hanged with Silk, Tapeſtry, and every corner ſumptuouſly and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluouſly adorned. No, no: but there were Hiſtories of the Old and New Teſtament to view and mark. I found not their Coffers full of Gold and Silver, Cup-boards of Plate, Preſſes of Silks, all manner of Mercery-ware, neither dainty Diſhes, delicate Drinks, bawdy Songs, wanton Muſick, the Lady of Love, her Son <hi>Cupid,</hi> nor any thing that Worldlings imbrace, but I found a thing far ſupaſſing all that is in the World.</p>
                  <p>This good, this joyfull, this comfortable, this unſpeakable, this incomprehenſible-thing, cannot be named worthily enough: but of good and bad he is called God, even he who is the only Soveraign good above all things reaſonable and unreaſonable. Peradventure you will ſay this is ſtoange news, that you Sir Knight ſhould ſee God in the Palace of <hi>Vertue.</hi> How is it ſtrange, ſeeing he is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, not only in Heaven, but alſo in Earth, and in Hell? Truly I confeſs that God is every where, but I deny him to dwell every
<pb facs="tcp:102717:46"/>where, and yet I know that by his power and invincible preſence he is every where, though not every where by the fulneſs of his greatneſs, and his gifts: it followes then that he dwelleth every where: I pray you what profiteth it the damned, that he is in hell by his power, Iuſtice, and Vengeance? Truly by ſuch preſence of God they have no joy, no conſolation, no benefit or ſelicity, for that all are curſed in whom God dwelleth not by his grace, whatſoever they be, be they Kings, Princes, or Popes, who have all other riches and delights in the World. But all they that have the grace of God are happy, or at leaſt wiſe in hope, though they live even in a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome priſon and are poorer than <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which deſired to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with the crums that fell from the evil rich Mans Table. Now, when we pray to God, we ſay; <hi>Our Father which art in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> for, that is the place where God gives the enjoying and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of himſelf to his elect, and that is their dwelling, prepared by the grace of God. That is that God ſpeaks of, by the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Heaven is my ſeat, and the Earth is my foot-ſtoole:</hi> For aſmuch ſaith God, as I dwell in mine Elect by Grace, I will tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at my feet thoſe that love <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> rather then their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. In the book of Wiſdom, it is written: That the ſeat of wiſdom is in the ſoul of the juſt, God is wiſdom, and the juſt ſoul his ſeat, God is in every place where he dwelleth, but he dwelleth not in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place where he is. This is moſt true, though marvellous, for the evil are alwayes where God is, but yet God dwelleth not in them. Whereſoever the wicked are, they cannot hide themſelves from God, and yet they are not dwellers with God, nor God a dweller with them. They are where God is, as the blind man in the Light of the Sun: the Light is not in him, becauſe he hath not the uſe of it. But the good are alwayes with God, and God dwelleth in them, as in his Temple. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That the temple of God is holy. And therefore iſ ye live well as he commands you, you are his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And God himſelf ſaith, <hi>I will be in them, I will walk amongſt them; I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſee that although God be every where in his power, yet he dwelleth no where, but where he is by grace. It is plain, that where Vertue is, there God inhabiteth by grace, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſolation of all reaſonable Creatures. Is it poſſible that any Man can find in Heaven or in Earth, ſuch Soveraign good as is in God, who is the moſt excellenteſt and chiefeſt good, and the
<pb facs="tcp:102717:46"/>true joy of all reaſonable Creatures? Now can that body fail in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goodneſs, which hath God by his Grace reſting in his Heart, who is the only Authour of all goodneſs, and the giver of all true Ioy and perſect Felicity.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay that they ſee good People in the World often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuffer miſery, deprived of their goods, and put by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this world, which appeareth in the ſadneſs of their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: for they ſeem to be conceived with ſorrow, and as it were to labour and travel in heavineſs, as a Woman in Child birth. I confeſs it to be ſo, but yet if you ſay that they are not ſurniſhed with all good and true joy and Felicity, you err greatly. For the Soveraign good which is God, dwels in the juſt ſoul for evermore: although fooliſh Worldings ſay in their Hearts and thoughts: Can it be that thoſe miſerable men, which are afflicted with poverty or impriſonment, have more poſſeſſion of true Felicity, than we that wallow in Wealth, and are without want of any Worldly pleaſures? But they conſider not that true Ioy conſiſteth in the Soul. But be you ſure, that as the Soul is the moſt precious part of the body, ſo ought the goodneſs of the Soul to be greater than the goodneſs of the body; The Ioy of the Iuſt and Righteous is more inward than outward, for all his goodneſs is in the ſoul: as the joy of wanton Worldlings is outwardly in the body. This juſt Man ſuffereth outward extremities, but yet inwardly he hath more joy than the Voluptuous Man. And though the juſt man, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes afflicted, maketh ſhew of ſadneſs all his life time, yet at the hour of death their joy and conſolation appeareth, with hope of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life: whereas contrariwiſe the Wordling goeth his way with grudging and deſpair; The juſt man eſteems Gold and Silver to be coloured Earth, worldly wealth and Voluptuous ſeeding to be Famine and Filth: Honour, Dignity, and Delight, to be ſmoak, which the Air conſumeth ſuddenly: to be ſhort, he maketh all the World no better than an exile: and although his body be detained here for a ſeaſon, yet all his thoughts, cares, deſires, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are converſant among the Orders of holy Angels, and the happy Aſſembly of Saints in Heaven ſinging Pſalms and Prayſes inceſſantly. So that whatſoever we eſteem evill in this World, God turns it to good. For he makes us rejoyce in Tribulations, taking them for medicines to purge our corruptions, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting our Perſecutors as our Enemies, but rather as Helpers to ſalvation.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:102717:47"/>
                  <p>The juſt Man eſteems ſimple fare, ſufficing nature, better than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of delicate or exceſſive Drunkenneſs, or Gluttony. They take more pleaſure in kneeling, praying, and faſting, then world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings do in dancing, and ſinging wanton Songs. Finally, that they do or ſuffer God turns it to good. And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>all things turn to the good of thoſe that love God:</hi> The eye never ſeeth, the Ear never heareth, the Heart of Man never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth the great goodneſs and the joy that God brings into the body, when he cometh, by grace, to dwell in it; only he that hath had experience once knoweth it. Worldlings do wonder to ſee the juſt man weep and lament, to ſuffer tribulations, and to be deprived of all worldly pleaſure, they eſteem the goods of this world to be the true felicity: much like unto a blind man, taking upon him to judge of colours. For they compare falſe felicity and worldly wealth, with heavenly Riches and perfect Happineſs; whereas indeed they are but ſhadowess. Nothing diſpleaſeth the Elect more than Sin, and that which leadeth to Sin: nothing pleaſeth the elect but God, and that which leadeth to God.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the ſoul, no man can deny, if he hate Sin, and love Vertue, but that he had rather loſe all that is in the world, than loſe Vertue, and ſuffer all manner of torments, than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Sin: he had rather deſcend into Hell with Vertue, than mount up to Heaven with Sin. For where Vertue is, there is quietneſs. Contrariwiſe, where ſin is, there can be no reſt. Let every one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labour to loſe worldly happineſs, if he mean to atchieve vertue, wherein conſiſteth ſo much goodneſs. But many make no account to come thither, and ſo care not for loving Vertue, becauſe indeed they know not Vertue; Wherefore Vnderſtanding deſcribeth her, and her ſeven Daughters, namely <hi>Faith, Hope, Charity, Wiſdom, Juſtice, Fortitude,</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> in manner following.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>VErtue,</hi> according to the Definition of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book of <hi>Free-will,</hi> the <hi>18</hi> Chapter, <hi>Is a good quality of the Soul, whereby a man liveth rightly, and committeth none evill; which thing indeed is the only work of God in Man.</hi> By the Soul he underſtandeth in this place the Superiour part of the Mind or Soul wherein conſiſteth Reaſon, Iugdment, and Will,
<pb facs="tcp:102717:47"/>The inferiour part we call <hi>Senſe,</hi> which is common to man and beaſt. Now that is called in Latine <hi>Mens,</hi> and is not a part of the Soul ſenſitive, which is the inferiour part, but it is that part of the Sool, where reaſon and Vnderſtanding do fit, which is the ſuperiour part. By the Soul then we do mean the Freewill of Man, which is nothing elſe, as Philoſophers ſay, but the frank judgment of the mind, and Will. For when we ſay, <hi>free will,</hi> we utter and pronounce two words, namely, <hi>free-will.</hi> It is termed <hi>free,</hi> becauſe that freely without conſtraint the will worketh his feats at liberty. And it is called <hi>free-will,</hi> becauſe of the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Saul. Therefore <hi>free-will</hi> is in the ſuperiour part of the Soul, for thereby we differ from bruit beaſts, who have a Senſe as well as we, but no judgment of <hi>free-will.</hi> Now then we ſay, that <hi>Vertue</hi> is a good quality of the Soul, that is to ſay, of <hi>free-will:</hi> For <hi>Vertue</hi> qualifies <hi>free-will,</hi> diſpoſeth and prepareth it to do and will well, neither of which can be done without the aid and Grace of God.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of the Deſinition is: <hi>Whereby a man liveth rightly.</hi> But no Man liveth rightly, unleſs he live juſtly; no man liveth rightly without Vertue, <hi>Ergo,</hi> no man liveth juſtly without Vertue. Who ſo liveth rightly liveth well, and who ſo liveth well, if he continue in ſo doing, atchieveth true <hi>felicity.</hi> It followeth then that by Vertue we atchieve true <hi>felicity,</hi> for <hi>Vertue</hi> prepares <hi>free-will,</hi> which is corrupt and depraved, and therefore unapt either for well-willing, or well-doing: but the Grace of God preſerving it by <hi>Vertue,</hi> it is made capable of perfect bleſſedneſs.</p>

                     </gap> that by Vertue, which he ſaith is <hi>Gods grace,</hi> inclining and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Will to will well, proceedeth the good affection of the Soul, and afterwards do follow good works, and an honeſt trade of Life. To make it the more manifeſt, he gives ſimilitudes. As the rain (ſaith he) moiſtneth the ground to make it yield fruit: and yet the rain is not the ground, nor the ground the fruit, even ſo (ſaith he) into the ground of our Souls, that is to ſay, the free liberty of the Will, the rain of Gods bleſſing is poured, that is to ſay, <hi>Gods grace</hi> is inſpired, which liquereth the will of man to make him fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to will well, according to the effect of Gods inſpiration, which is his Grace working in us, to the end we ſhould do well. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the good works that we do or can do, are to be attributed unto <hi>Gods grace,</hi> by whom our will is prepared to will and do well. This grace ingendreth good motions in the ſoul of Man, and theſe good motions are a chief gift of Grace to Man, as namely, by faith to believe that Chriſt is the true Son of God: by Love and Charity, to love God and our Neighbour: and ſo of all other Vertues, which are the good Motions and Gifts of <hi>Gods grace,</hi> working in us, to the encreaſe of more Vertue, yea, to the peſſeſſion of eternal life. It is apparent then, that Vertue is the gift of <hi>Gods grace,</hi> working in our will to make it will and do well: and therefore ſay we, that <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> being Divine and godly Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, are the works of God. Some there be which ſay, that Vertue is the well uſing of the naturall Powers and abilities in Man, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward only, but not outward, that is to ſay, a perfect affection of the ſoul, which God precureth in man, and not Man in himſelf. For
<pb facs="tcp:102717:48"/>although ſuch motions ſeem to be motions of free-will, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuch, except God vauchſafe of his working Grace to ſanctifie the will, and to make it capable of ſuch good affections: Theſe two Opinions recited by the Maſter of the Sentences, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book, and <hi>27</hi> Diſtinction, I refer to the Iudgment of the Reader, and allow them ſo far forth as they both agree, that <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> is a work of God in Man, and not of Man in himſelf. But yet they differ, becauſe the firſt ſayes, that <hi>Vertue</hi> is not a moving of the Soul, for that it is the only working of God, without Man, and of meer Grace: the other Opinion ſaith that <hi>Vertue</hi> is a good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man, not coming of God in Man: I dare not judge raſhly in ſo High and ſecret a Myſtery, and therefore I appeal to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Learned. It ſufficeth to know that <hi>Vertue</hi> is a work of God in Man, and not of Man in himſelf; and in this point, as both Opinions do conſent, ſo I approve them to be true.</p>

                     <p>The Deſcription of Faith, and how we ought to believe in God for our ſalvation</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FAith is a Vertue, whereby we believe that which we ſee not.</hi> When it is ſaid that <hi>Faith</hi> is a Vertue, it is moſt manifeſt that <hi>faith</hi> is the pure gift of God, whereby we believe that which we ſee not. But yet it followeth not that we ſhould believe all that we hear and ſee not, but this is meant only in things touching Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Worſhipping of God. Faith is properly of things not apparent, for apparent things have no Faith, but a certain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration: as when our Lord ſaith to <hi>Thomas,</hi> Becauſe thou haſt ſeen, thou believeſt. Yet <hi>Thomas</hi> believed more than he ſaw, <hi>a</hi> Man, and he believed that the ſame Man was God alſo, which he ſaw not: for he ſaid, <hi>Thou art my God, and my Lord.</hi> In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the merit of <hi>Faith,</hi> when a man at the Commandement of God, believeth that thing which he ſeeth not. <hi>To believe</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin) is to think upon a thing with conſent to that thought:</hi> as when thou thinkeſt the Son of God was born of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> and toah mans nature upon him, and conſenteſt to that Thought, it is properly called Beliefe. This thought may come often by ſeeing, and often by hearing. And when Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:102717:49"/>ſaith, that <hi>faith cometh by hearing of the word of God,</hi> he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands that by hearing <hi>faith</hi> comes into the mind and thought, if we conſent thereunto. For we may hear a Preacher, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to that he ſaith, becauſe men do not alwayes believe what the Preacher ſpeaketh, for that the conſent wherein conſiſteth the perfection of Faith, comes of the meer gift of God, and not from ſeeing nor hearing, but from the light of Grace, ſpeaking in the Soul of the Believer, believing the principal truth, which is God, and working in him an agreement with that Soveraign truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other things. So that <hi>Faith</hi> is a foundation unmovable: our Lord Ieſus Chriſt who is the only Foundation of true Bleſſedneſs, dwelleth in the Hearts of the Believers, and ſo long as Faith is in Man, he ſhall be ſure not to periſh; but <hi>faith</hi> without <hi>Charity</hi> is no Foundation, becauſe ſuch Faith is in vain and unprofitable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faith</hi> then joyned with <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> belongs to good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: and <hi>Faith</hi> without <hi>Love</hi> belongs to evill Chriſtians. It is neceſſary therefore that we note the difference in theſe three ſayings or ſpeeches, namely: <hi>To believe a God, To believe of God, To believe in God. To believe a God,</hi> is to believe that he is the only true God, ſo the Devils do believe as well as the evill Chriſtians. <hi>To believe of God,</hi> is to believe that all is true which God ſaith, and ſo believe the evill Chriſtians as well as the good, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be Hereticks. But <hi>to believe in God,</hi> is to love God, and in believing to joyn thy ſelf to God, by love and obedience incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating thee with His Members, that is to ſay, his Church.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Faith</hi> juſtiſteth the Sinner, and this <hi>Faith</hi> being knit with <hi>Love</hi> and with <hi>Charity,</hi> begins to do good deeds, which cannot be done without <hi>Love.</hi> The <hi>Faith</hi> which evill Chriſtians have, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a quality of <hi>free will,</hi> but it is not knit with <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> which is the bond of perfection, and the life of <hi>faith,</hi> as <hi>Faith</hi> is the Life of the Soul. And yet ſuch an unſhapen <hi>Faith,</hi> being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and Void of <hi>Charity,</hi> may be termed a gift of God: for that the evill man may have ſome gift of God: but that cannot proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called Vertue, becauſe that by Vertue we learn to live right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and for that the Devils and Evill Chriſtians do live wickedly, it is a ſign that the <hi>faith</hi> which they have is dead, and therefore is not properly Vertue, nor yet a work of Vertue. If thou wilt then have thy Faith to be good and ſaving, it muſt have four proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that is to ſay, it muſt be plain and ſimple, it muſt be whole
<pb facs="tcp:102717:49"/>and ſound, it muſt be conſtant and unmovable, it muſt be quick and lively. Touching the firſt, that it muſt be plain and ſimple, that teacheth thee thus much in effect, that thou muſt believe the word of God ſimply, and whatſoever is therein contained, without inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into Gods myſtical matters by humane Reaſons: and ſimply believing in thy heart that every thing contained in the holy bible is moſt true. Secondly, thy <hi>Faith</hi> muſt be whole and ſound, that is, thou muſt not take part with Hereticks, or cleave to the erronious Opinions of the Enemies of Gods truth: for this is no good <hi>faith.</hi> And therefore for a Teſtimony of thy <hi>Faith,</hi> be not aſhamed to make open Confeſſion in the Congregation of thy belief, with the Fellowſhip and Communion of Saints, That thou believeſt in God the Creator and Governour of all things, &amp; in his Son Ieſus Chriſt the Redeemer, and in the holy Gheſt, by which we are ſanctified and receive true comſort and joy, &amp;c. according as it is declared in his holy word. Thirdly, it muſt be conſtant and unmovable, that is, without doubting, for any reaſon of Mans brain that ſeemeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, or for any temptation, promiſe, or threatnings, either of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or of death. And let not the obſtinacy of ſuch as enchant with the vain pleaſures of this life, although they ſeem to live moſt joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, allure thee to cleave to their opinion, which is ſiat hereſie: for that is a work of Satans who wholly poſſeſſes them, &amp; can change himſelf into an Angel of light, to deceive the ſimple and innocent, whom God permits to be tempted for the tryal of their conſtancy. Not that he is ignorant of the iſſue, but becauſe he would have it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in others, that he crownes us with glory, for our conſtancy and perſeverance. This is clearly ſet down by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the <hi>13.</hi> of <hi>Deut.</hi> and by S. <hi>Peter</hi> in his <hi>2</hi> Epiſtle, chap. <hi>2,</hi> and by our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, in the <hi>24</hi> of <hi>Matthew.</hi> And though we live in the later times, when many Sects do abound, and Vertue and truth in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do fail: yet let us liſten what our Saviour ſaith: <hi>Whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth to the end, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Fourthly and laſtly, thy Faith muſt be quick and lively, that is, it muſt be linked with love and charity, which is the life of faith, as the Soul is the life of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And therefore abuſe not thy ſelf, as ſome do, ſaying: I have Faith, and I ſhall be ſaved, whatſoever chance. No, no, aſſure thy ſelf, that if thy Faith be not quickned with Love and Cherity, it is nothing Worth, and therefore unable to atchieve true Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> well noteth in the firſt Epiſtle, the <hi>13</hi> chap. to the
<pb facs="tcp:102717:50"/>
                     <hi>Corinth.</hi> Even ſo, when our Lord in the Goſpel attributeth ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto Faith, and S. Paul juſtification: this is to be underſtood of an holy, lively, and Evangelical Faith, working with Love and Charity. Likewiſe when our Saviour ſaith in the Goſpel, that he <hi>which believeth and will be Baptiſed, ſhall be ſaved:</hi> that is meant of ſuch a Faith, as love quickneth, and Charity reviveth. The holy Scripture in many places expreſſeth, that none ſhall be ſaved, unleſs he obſerve and keep the Commandements of God. Now none can keep the Commandements without Love and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Ergo,</hi> none can be ſaved without Love and Charity. The ſum and effect of all is this, That whoſoever renounceth Sin, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth a quick and lively Faith, and liveth in Love and Charity, he cannot periſh, but ſhall find in the end perfect and everlaſting Felicity, in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

                     <p>The Deſcription of Hope, and how we ought to hope in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NOw (Sir Knight) know this, that <hi>Hope is a Vertue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Happineſs or Bleſſedneſs both ſpiritual and eternal are hoped for.</hi> And as <hi>Faith</hi> is of things not ſeen, ſo is <hi>Hope</hi> alſo. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hope</hi> that is ſeen is no <hi>Hope,</hi> becauſe we have poſſeſſion of it already. It is common to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> to be of things unſeen: and yet <hi>Hope</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Faith,</hi> not only by name, but by reaſon. For by <hi>Faith</hi> we believe as well evill things as good, that is Hell as Heaven. We believe that Adultery is a very wicked ſin, we believe alſo Charity is a very good thing: all theſe things good and bad, we believe, but we Hope only for good things, and not for bad. Again, Faith is of things paſt; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to come. For we believe the death of Ieſus Chriſt which is paſt: we believe alſo that at this preſent he ſits at the right hand of God the Father in Heaven, and we believe that Chriſt ſhall come to judge the quick and the dead. But under correction, I think that <hi>Hope</hi> is of things preſent: as when I Hope that I am in Gods favour: and of things paſt, as when I Hope my Sins be forgiven me: and of things to come, as when I Hope to have eternal life. This is true that Faith hath an eye generally unto that which is ſpoken in holy Scripture, believing that all the promiſes, without exception, which God made, ſhall be accompliſhed, without deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to particular or ſpecial Perſons: but Hope applyeth unto her
<pb facs="tcp:102717:50"/>ſelf thoſe ſame promiſes, waiting for the accompliſhment of that which God hath promiſed. And therefore it is requiſite for aſſured Salvation, that thou believe thou ſhalt be ſaved, but to Hope ſo is not ſufficient. For Faith, in it ſelf, importeth an infallible aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and certainty of things, as when we firmly believe all the Articles of our true and Chriſtian Faith, and all things contained in the holy Scriptures to be more certain then man is man: but the hoping of it is not ſo requiſite. For if we have a firm aſſiance in the goodneſs of God, touching our Salvation, and doubt not a whit of the remiſſion of our ſins, it is enough. There be two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in Hope, which are two contrary extremities. The one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt higheſt, is the infallible aſſurance of eternal Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The other being the baſeſt and loweſt, is to deſpair of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Between theſe two extremities conſiſteth Hope. But the more that a Man approacheth to the higheſt extremity, which is an infallible aſſurance of Eternal life, and the more he rejoyceth from the loweſt extremity, which is deſperation, the more perfect he is in hope. As it ſufficeth the hoping Man, that believes an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> loves God, that he hath a firm affiance and confidence, that God of his good grace will give him whatſoever he hath promiſed to his Elect, hoping that he is of their number. So it is neceſſarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſte that we have a perfect infallible certainty of our Salvation. Now for that in the Definition of <hi>Hope,</hi> it is ſaid, that by her we Hope and look for the eternal Happineſs; it is to be noted, that Hope hath two Objects; the firſt, the perfect enjoying of Gods preſence: the other is, all the neceſſary means to come unto the clear ſeeing and enjoying of God: and theſe means are remiſſion of Sins through <hi>Gods Grace,</hi> juſtification, <hi>Faith</hi> unfained, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable deeds, and agreeableneſs unto God. Now all that we hope for, we ought with prayer devoutly to crave of God; as his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the remiſſion of our ſins, juſtification, encreaſe of Grace and Vertue, deeds of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> But concerning goods tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, foraſmuch as we may uſe them well and ill, they may be ſaid to hinder the Salvation of Man, rather then to ſurther it. And therefore the good Chriſtian ought not to ask them, nor covet them exceſſively: indeed ſo much as will neceſſarily ſerve him for ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in this life, he may lawfully ask. and here by the way, it is a leſſon worthy the Learning, namely: that it is neceſſary for us to do good Works, becauſe it hath pleaſed God to enrich us with
<pb facs="tcp:102717:51"/>Goods, which Goods ought well to be employed. Now unto him properly belongeth the merits of the works which he worketh in us. For all our good works are the gift of God, howbeit he doth not deny us his Grace, whereby we conſent to do the good works which he only moveth in us.</p>
                  <p>And therefore every one ought, to the uttermoſt that he is able, to do good works, conſidering that they come of God, who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all good works, and without whom we are not able to think ſo much as one good thought, much leſs do a good deed. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to hope in doing ill to go to heaven, without good works ſpringing from a firm <hi>faith,</hi> is not hope, but a flat preſumption. And therefore thou oughteſt to enforce thy ſelf to do good works, hoping that thou and thy works may be acceptable unto God: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, thou muſt not in any caſe truſt upon thy merits or good works, but altogether to the infinite goodneſs of God. For otherwiſe thou falleſt into that curſe which the Prophet ſpeaketh, ſaying, <hi>Curſed is the man that truſteth in man,</hi> and contrariwiſe, <hi>happy is the man that truſteth in God.</hi> We ought alwayes to do well, to delight in well-doing, and to hope in the goodneſs of God, that he will give us that which he hath promiſed. But this <hi>Hope</hi> ought to be firm, and as an Anchor conſtantly to hold thy conſcience, that by the float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of temptation it move not. But ſome will ask by what teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or witneſs can the conſcience reſt aſſured of remiſſion of ſins, of Gods adoption, and of Heavenly bleſſedneſs. I anſwer, S. <hi>John</hi> Epiſt. <hi>1</hi> chap. <hi>5.</hi> ſaith, <hi>There be three things that bear witneſs in Earth, that is, the Spirit, Water, and Blood.</hi> Theſe three teſtifie unto the ſpirit of the believing Man, that Chriſt is the infallible truth, who fulfilleth in the believing man the whole ſum of his promiſes. The firſt witneſs then that aſſureth man in Hope is the precious bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which was ſhed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſien of our ſins. The ſecond witneſs is the water of Baptiſm, by the which alſo our ſins are forgiven. But theſe two witneſſes put not the conſcience in full and perfect Hope and Aſſurance. And therefore there muſt be annexed unto them a third; which third is, The holy Spirit, which beareth witneſs with our ſpirit, that we are the Sons and Heirs of God. Who ſo hath not this witneſs, he cannot be aſſured of his Salvation. The works of the holy Spirit in Man, if thou ask me what thoſe works are, I anſwer thee, that they are theſe that follow, and ſuch like; namely, Sorrow for ſin; hatred of all things which diſpleaſe God, and are contrary to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements;
<pb facs="tcp:102717:51"/>taking pleaſure to read and hear Gods word; mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for thy imperfections; and ſure <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity:</hi> and effection, deſire, intent and purpoſe to love God above all things, and to do thy endeavour to fulfill his Commandements. For all theſe things ſpring not from the corrupt nature of man, unleſs his Heart be moyſtened with the dew of <hi>Gods grace:</hi> without the which we feel not in our ſelves any good affections, nor deſire to do good works, which are ſigns of the preſence of the holy Cheſt in us. Wherefore we ought with ſighing to pray unto God, and to beſeech him moſt humbly that it would pleaſe him of his unſpeakable pity, to ſend us his holy Spirit, which may aſſure us of the remiſſion of our ſins: to Vouchſafe us his heavenly Adoption, and the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of everlaſting Bleſſedneſs. And thus much concerning <hi>Hope.</hi> New let us ſpeak of <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Charity.</hi>

                     <hi>CHarity is a Vertue, by the which God is loved for the love of himſelf; and our neighbour for the love of God, or in God.</hi> It is ſaid in the firſt part of this Deſinition, that <hi>Charity</hi> is a Vertue. Let us ſee how: certainly <hi>Charity</hi> in the excellenteſt vertue that is, even the mother and nurſe of all the reſt. For he that hath not <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> hath nothing in him to obtain everlaſting life. This <hi>Charity</hi> is given when the holy Spirit it is given.

And that is to be done three wayes, that is, to love God above all things entirely, above all things orderly, above all things preciouſly. We will declare theſe three wayes of loving God the more plainly, that every one may know how to love God.</p>
                  <p>To love God intirely, is to have a good will to God, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce greatly that he is ſuch a one as he is: But for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding hereof, it ſhall not be amiſs to ſhew <hi>what it is to love;</hi> to love is nothing elſe, but <hi>to wiſh well to every body:</hi> as when I love a man, I wiſh as well to him as to my ſelf: Now there are two manners of love.

<pb facs="tcp:102717:52"/>for the love of it ſelf, without reſpect of particular profit: as when I ſee a man wiſe, I take pleaſure in him, and wiſh that the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which are in him may not only be continued, but alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in him, and this do I, being to him well affectionated, and loving him with delight.</p>
                  <p>There is not in God and good that is not like himſelf. For his might or Power, his Wiſdom, his Mercy, his Iuſtice, and his knowledge are Heavenly, as he himſelf is, who is all wiſe, all juſt, all mercy, all knowledge, and all mighty; So that we love God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things intirely, when we rejoyce and be glad that he is as he is, without regarding our proper profit or honour. Thou oughteſt not to love God with a covetous love, that is, thou muſt not love God only becauſe he gives thee all things profitable for thee: or in ſo doing thou loveſt thy ſelf better then thou loveſt God. If thou love God rightly, he will reward thee greatly: but this love muſt be ſingle and it muſt be pure, and not depending upon any other thing: for who ſo loveth God for gain, loveth him but as his Horſe, in whom he delights, becauſe he ſerves his turn. God ought to be loved lovingly, without reſpect of particular profit.</p>
                  <p>But then maiſt ask me a queſtion; May I not love God to this end, and under this condition, that he may give me Heaven, which is the principalleſt thing that Man can wiſh for after this life? the Doctors ſay no, if we conſider well of the thing beloved, which is God: for in ſo doing, thou loveſt thy ſelf better then thou loveſt God. Thou maiſt come to Heaven by this means, as namely, by keeping his Commandements, by giving Alms, and by doing other good deeds, and yet give God his due and ſingle love. Now theſe things are not charity it ſelf, but the works of Charity. We ſay then that God ought to he loved in doing good deeds, and in keeping his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: but this love ought to be entire, without reſpect of profit or reward.</p>
                  <p>To love God orderly above all things is to refer thy ſelf and all thy goods to God: ſo that all which thou loveſt, wiſheſt, doſt, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſt undone, thou oughteſt to love, to wiſh, to doe, and leave undone, for the love of God and his glory. Thus referring all to the Honour and Glory of God, thou loveſt God above all things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darly, and accompliſheſt, as much as in thee lyeth, what is written in <hi>Deut.</hi> and in Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> where it is ſaid; <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, and with all
<pb facs="tcp:102717:52"/>thy ſtrength:</hi> For what other thing is it to love God with all thine heart, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength, but to refer all things to God, and to his glory, all our thoughts, all our worde, all our works, all our purpoſes, and all our intents? To love God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore above all things orderly, is to refer to God and his glory our ſelves, and all that is within and without us; which we cannot well do, if our thougts, if our words, if our works, be not good and acceptable unto God.</p>
                  <p>To love God preciouſly, is to love him ſo dearly, and ſo much to eſteem of him, that for no cauſe thou wouldeſt loſe him, nor his love: but wiſh rather to loſe thy goods, thy lands, thy limbs, thy life, and the love of the World. This indeed is to love God lovingly, when without reſpect of profit we referr to God and his glory all that we have, our hearts, our hands, our lips, to praiſe and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine him, and to ſet forth the greatneſs of his Divine Majeſty, and omnipotency. To love God then for the love of himſelf, is to love God becauſe he is good. And he that loveth God in this ſort ſhall be ſure never to miſcarry or periſh.</p>
                  <p>To love thy Neighbour, it is required that thou do it in God, or for the love of God. Now thou muſt underſtand that every Man is thy Neighbour, when either thou to them, or they to thee can ſhew mercy or relief, by ſuccour and help. So that every reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is thy Neighbour, whereſoever he dwell in the World. Thus are the Saints in Heaven thy Neighbours, by whoſe example thou art taught to live godly; wherefore thou oughreſt to love them and all mankind for the love of God, or in God. Thou oughteſt to love thy Neighbour, becauſe he is good, or becauſe he ſhould be good, then thou loveſt him indeed for the love of God: every Man which is a Sinner thou oughteſt to love, not becauſe he is a ſinner, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a Man, for the love of God.</p>
                  <p>Thou oughteſt to love in the ſinfull Man that which he hateth, and to hate that which he loveth. The ſinfull Man loves ſin and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity, which thou oughteſt to hate: The ſinfull Man hateth his Soul and the purity of Nature, which thou oughteſt to love. For Sin is againſt nature, it defileth Nature, it oppreſſeth nature, yea, it quencheth nature, and he that committeth ſin killeth his own ſoul, and corupteth nature. Thou oughteſt then to love the Soul, and the Nature of the Sinner, but not his ſin. And when thou giveſt Alms to a ſinner being in need, thou oughteſt not to do it becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:102717:53"/>he is a Man, but becauſe he is a man of the ſame nature that thou art. Some be thy friends, and ſome thy Enemies; thy friends thou oughteſt to love in God, leſt loving them otherwiſe, thou ſhouldeſt offend God. Thy Enemie thou oughteſt to love, for the Love of God: and if he offend thee in word or deed, and doth repent him, and asketh thee forgiveneſs, thou oughteſt for the love of God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him with all thy heart, and to receive into friendſhip. Again, if thy Enemy be obſtinate and will not ceaſe to perſecute thee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou canſt not preſently forgive him, yet thou oughteſt not to hate him, but rather to do him good, and to be ready alwayes to pardon him, and then chiefly when he ſhall raquire it. Yea thou oughteſt to do him what good thou canſt in his need.</p>
                  <p>By that which we have ſpoken already it appeareth, that thou oughteſt to love all men living, both good and bad, friends and foes, no worſe then thy ſelf. Our Lord had an eye to the love of our Neighbour, when he ſaid in the <hi>7</hi> of <hi>Matthew. All things that thou wouldeſt thy Neighbour ſhould do unto thee, do thou the like to him.</hi> Whoſoever then doth to his Neighbour as be would his Neighbour ſhould do to him, loveth his Neighbour as himſelf. But this is to be underſtood according to God and reaſon. For if one offering to pleaſure thee, bring thee a Wench to lye with thee, or lend thee a ſword to fight, and to kill another, as reaſon would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct thee to refuſe ſuch offers, ſo the love according to God ſhould teach thee obedience, and they both ought to be the rule of thy life, and the lights to guide thee in the dark places. Thus far have we declared, in as much brevity as we could, how a man ought to love God and his Neighbour. Now intend we to ſhew the effects of love and Charity.</p>

                     <p>The effects and praiſes of Love and Charity.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NO tongue in the World can tell for truth all the Excellency of the effects and praiſes of <hi>love</hi> or <hi>charity:</hi> For firſt of all, ſhe makes men the Children of God, and Heirs of Heaven: according to that ſaying of Saint <hi>John; behold what <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Charity</hi> the Father hath ſhewed unto us, to make us the Children of God.</hi> S. <hi>Paul alſo ſaith; That thoſe which be lead by the Spirit of God, are the Children of God: For you have not received the ſpirit of bondage, to fear any more; but you have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> and that ſame Spirit</hi> (which is the Spirit of Love or Charity) <hi>beareth witneſs with
<pb facs="tcp:102717:53"/>our Spirit, that we be the Children and Heirs of God, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs with Chriſt.</hi> Can we deſire a thing more excellent, than to be the children of God and Heirs of Heaven? what dignity is that to boaſt of? Such as have feeling of the love of God in their hearts, have boldneſs &amp; courage, though the world contemn them. For this is certain, that they whom the world hateth, are not the children of the world, but the children of God: as contrariwiſe, ſuch as the world loveth, they indeed are the children of the world. Secondly, Charity worketh the cauſe in us, that God dwelleth in us: <hi>who dwelleth in Charity,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>John, dwelleth in God, and God in him</hi> Our Lord likewiſe ſaith. If <hi>any Man love me he will keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and my Father will come and dwell with him.</hi> Can we deſire a more rich, a more bountifull, or a more liveral Hoſt than he? Is it like that ſo loving an Hoſt will ſuffer the ſoul to want: Will he ask mony for his expences? No, he commeth not to dwell with us to conſume that we have, but to encreaſe our riches, and to make our ſtore greater. Thirdly, Charity maketh our goods, be they little or be they much, acceptable unto God: it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Man contemn the World, it maketh a man to rejoyce in temptations, and tribulations. When Charity enters into the ſoul, ſhe knits us to God, and uniteth us with him. Love or Charity makes men of one mind, and will. Love or Charity makes men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their manners, and to draw near unto God. Love or Charity makes men to conſider of things preſent and viſible, as if they were not. Love maketh a pure and clean heart, which may contemplate and behold Heavenly things. By love, the Goods of this World are well ordered, and by Love the Goods of this World are contemned; and by Love the ſecrets of God are revealed. Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, That God is Love or Charity, whereby no doubt he meaneth the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt, the three perſons in Trinity: God the Father is Charity, God the Son is Charity, and God the holy Ghoſt is charity. This Love or Charity requireth in the ſame ſuch likely things, namely, love and charity, by the which, as by ſome ſpiritual affinity thou art joyned unto God, which <hi>Love</hi> alſo boldly commeth unto God, and familiarly ſpeaketh unto him, without any doubt or fear. He that loveth not, ſhall loſe his Life: but He that loveth, alwayes lifteth his eyes to God, whom be loveth, whom he deſireth, on whom he muſeth, in whom he is refreſhed, and by whom he is preſerved: ſuch a debour
<pb facs="tcp:102717:54"/>and religious ſoul doth ſo ſing, ſo ſay, read, ſo diſpoſe all his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſo circumſpectly foreſeeth all things, as if God were ever preſent with Him, as doubtleſs in ſpirit he is. The man in whoſe ſoul the love of God is lodged, ſo prayeth, as if God were perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent with Him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> awaketh the ſoul when ſhe is aſleep, it puts him in mind of His Salvation, it ſoftneth and moyſteneth the Heart. <hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> ſetteth the cold Heart on fire. <hi>Love</hi> maketh the froward ſoul gentle. <hi>Love</hi> chaſeth away ſin. <hi>Love</hi> keepeth the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the fleſh and blood under. <hi>Love</hi> amendeth Iewd Mens manners. <hi>Love</hi> reneweth the Spirit. <hi>Love</hi> bridleth the light moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of wanton youth, all this worketh <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> where ſhe is preſent. Contrariwiſe where <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Charity</hi> is abſent, there the Soul doth Languiſh and waxeth cold: even as a Caldron of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth, when the fire is taken from under it, and raked abroad, <hi>Charity</hi> is the only thing whereby the ſoul boldly approacheth unto End, conſtantly cleaveth unto him, and familiarly ſpeaketh unto him. The Soul that loveth God cannot but think, and talk of God, inſomuch that it hateth all ungodly things. Who ſo will know God, muſt love God: the more that one loves God, the more be growes in the knowledge of God. To read, to write, and to ſtudy of God, yieldeth no true knowledge of God, without <hi>Love.</hi> In vian do we read, in Vain do we talli, in Vain do we preach, in Vain do we pray to God, if we do not love God; the love of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth the love of thine own Soul, and maketh it attentive al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to God. God loves to be loved again: and when he loveth, he requireth nothing but love: happy therefore is he that loveth God. The Soul which loveth God rejecteth his own effections, being earneſtly given to Gods love. The Soul that loveth hath no fear: the ſoul that loveth not, is ever in fear. The Soul that loveth, is carryed by promiſes, and drawn by deſires unto Heaven: the ſoul that hath in it the preſence of Gods love, is tickled with joy, and with raviſhing leapeth up to Heaven, having by coutemplation exceeding great joyfulneſs. Love breeds familiarity with God, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity breeds boldneſs with God, boldneſs breeds the taſte of God, and Taſte breedeth an hunger after God. If I ſhould declare all the excellency of <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> the time would fail me, and mine Ability in that behalfe would not ſuffice: But let this ſtand, for a concluſion, that the Soul which is touched with the love of God
<pb facs="tcp:102717:54"/>cannot deſire any thing contrary to God: but ever after it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any taſte of Sin, it cryeth out, and ſaith with the Prophet, <hi>Pſal. 14. O Lord God, like as the Hart deſireth the Fountains of water, even ſo long I after thee.</hi> Well then Sir Knight, lift up thy Soul, and remember the great <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> of God, and his maniſold benefits beſtowed upon thee, that by them thy Heart being enlightned, thou maiſt encreaſe and go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>By theſe ſour Marral Vertues Man liveth orderly in this martal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe. Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith that the Chriſtian man by theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> liveth well in this mortality, and by them after death cometh to everlaſting Life. <hi>Prudence</hi> knoweth the good we ſhould do, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil we ſhould leave. <hi>Juſtice</hi> doth good. <hi>Temperance</hi> leaveth the evill. <hi>Fortitude</hi> is conſtant, without loſing courage in adverſity, or waring proud in proſperity. <hi>Prudence</hi> teacheth man how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto God; <hi>Fortitude</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> how to govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>Juſtice,</hi> how to uſe his Neighbour. Theſe are the four things which Satan ſhooteth at, to deſtroy the Soul.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Prudence,</hi> which is the rule of right Reaſon, we govern our ſelves wiſely, we order our affairs diſcreetly, doing nothing but Right and reaſon. In <hi>Prudence</hi> conſiſteth Reaſon, Knowledge, Fore-ſight, Aptneſs to give good Counſell. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> is the Governeſs of all Moral Vertues, ſhewing how we ſhould underſtand and uſe the reſt: For as Faith informeth us what we ſhould hope after, and what we ought to love: even ſo <hi>Prudence</hi> teacheth us how we ſhould uſe <hi>Juſtice, Fortitude,</hi> and <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that it is impoſſible but a prudant Man ſhould be good. If he mean moral goodneſs, it is moſt true: for a wiſe Man doth nothing but that which is lawfull: But yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Love or Charity, <hi>Prudence</hi> is a Vertue no more meritorious,
<pb facs="tcp:102717:55"/>then Faith without Love and Charity. But if the prudent man love God with all his heart, it is unpoſſible but that he ſhould do good, and conſequently be good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Juſtice</hi> is a Vertue uſed in two ſorts, ſometimes it is a general Vertue, and comprehends in her ſelf all Vertue: as the man that Ilbeth well and juſtiy, is therefore called good: and Iuſtice o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe is underſtood a particular Vertue, called <hi>Juſtice</hi> diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive, yeelding to every one that which unto him belongeth. This Vertue, <hi>Juſtice</hi> diſtributive is convenient for all men, and principally for Emperours, Kings, and ſuch as have the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and Governments of Common-wealths; to the end that they may yeeld to every one their right, defending the innocent, and puniſhing the offender: doing juſtice and right, according to equity, as well to little as great, and to poor as rich. Many have juſtice painted in their Houſes, and yet have wrongfull dealing lodged in their hearts. Many a one hath Chriſt in their mouth, but the Devil in their minde. He that will be acceptable to GOD, he muſt be juſt in word, upright in deed, undefiled in thought.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fortitude</hi> is a vertue, unto which belongs a magniſicent cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, not fearing any thing but unlawful actions. He that hath this vertue, keeps himſelf conſtant in adverſity, and waxeth not proud in proſoerity. <hi>Fortitude</hi> gives a man Magnanimity, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, Hope, Aſſurance, Patience, and Perſeverance. With this Vertue the Martyrs of all Degrees and Ages were endued, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a firm Faith, contemning the world, and ſetting light by the torments of Lyrants, imbracing death, rather then to deny Chriſt. Gods Prophets were armed with <hi>Fortitude,</hi> who without ſiattery reprehended the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Juda</hi> of their falſ wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and feared not their furies. The Apoſtles of Ieſus Chriſt were armed with <hi>Fortitude,</hi> who feared not to controll the wiſdom of the wiſe, and vanquiſh ſuch as were in high places, that they might with contented mindes carry the yoak of Chriſt. This they did, not with mans power, or warlike weapons, but with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine Doctrine: not defiring to kill any one, but to die themſelves. It is a great worlds wonder, that ſo few ſimple ſouls, unarmed, unlearned, and having no humane policy, ſhould vanquiſh the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the World, confound earthly policy and ſtrength, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Kings, and bring them in obedience to the Faith of Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
<pb facs="tcp:102717:55"/>the People from falſe Religion and Adoration of Debils. With this Vertue of <hi>fortitude</hi> Kings ought to be Armed, not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any danger for the Defence of the Faith of Ieſus Chriſt, but being of one mind with the holy Martyrs of God. With this vertue ought Preachers to be armed, worthily defending the word of God, againſt all Hereticks and Enemies of the ſame, not fearing the threatnings of Perſecutors whatſoever. But you muſt underſtand that <hi>fortitude</hi> is not a dealer in the committing of unlawfull deeds: as to beat, hurt, or kill thy brother, unleſs it be juſtly done in thy own defence, or for thy Countries cauſe: otherwiſe it is a mere Malice. Moreover, ſuch as deſperately diſpatch themſelves, as Wretches weary of Life, they do it not by Fortitude, but by the Lemptation of the Devill, who is permitted of Gods ſufferance to tempt ſome even to the making away of themſelves. Such People are not Valiant, for it is not <hi>fortitude,</hi> unleſs it be in lawfull deeds, as in the defence of thine own Perſon, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, thy Country, or the Faith of Chriſt, for the which to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death is excellent <hi>fortitude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Temperance</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Auſten</hi>) is an affection to reſrain the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite when a Man is exceſſively inclined. <hi>Temperance</hi> hath rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pleaſures and delights, reſuſing to meddle in any thing which cannot be done without offending God, and not falling into any exceſs whatſoever, wherein a man may paſs the rule of reaſon. To live in <hi>Temperance,</hi> is to diſpoſe every thing according to the right uſe whereto it was appointed. Theſe four Vertues have four Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces clean contrary unto them, by the which Vices, the Vertues are corrupted and deſtroyed. <hi>Prudence</hi> by <hi>Folly, Juſtice</hi> by <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, Fortitude</hi> by <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Temperance</hi> by <hi>Inconſtancy</hi> is defaced. Theſe Vices are ſignified by the ſour plagues, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the Goods of <hi>Job,</hi> namely: The <hi>Sabees,</hi> the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> the force of <hi>Fire,</hi> and the Violence of a vehement <hi>Wind.</hi> The <hi>Sabees</hi> of <hi>Folly</hi> made havock of <hi>Prudence</hi> Oxen. The <hi>Chaldees</hi> of <hi>Pride</hi> led away the Camels of <hi>Fortitude.</hi> The fire of <hi>Lechery</hi> made waſte of <hi>Temperance</hi> Sheep. And the boyſterous winde of <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> overthrew the Houſes of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> The four Vertues likewiſe are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured of their adverſary Vices, according as <hi>Joel</hi> complaineth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wicked <hi>Jewes,</hi> under ſour notable things, decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phering the four Vices Oppoſite and againſt the ſour Vertues before-named. Theſe ſour things are the Caterpillar, the
<pb facs="tcp:102717:56"/>Graſhopper, the Locuſt, and the Blaſting: all which four things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vent to waſtfullneſs, leave nothing unſpoyled. By the Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar is meant fooliſh bragging, which deſtroyed the Vertue of <hi>Prudence.</hi> By the Graſhopper is meant Pride, which deſtroyeth the Vertue of <hi>Fortitude.</hi> By the Locuſt is meant Covetouſneſs, which deſtroyeth the Vertue of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> And by Blaſting is meant Lechery, which deſtroyeth the Vertue of <hi>Temperance.</hi> For fooliſh bragging deſtroyeth the Vertue of Wiſdem.

For <hi>Faith</hi> properly is not without <hi>Hope,</hi> nor <hi>Hope</hi> without <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and therefore they muſt go all together. And though theſe Vertues have ſeveral properties, yet they joyn hands, and are never aſunder. S. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was furniſhed with <hi>Faith, Job</hi> with <hi>Fortitude</hi> and <hi>patience, David</hi> with <hi>Humility,</hi> and ſo conſeouently.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Faith</hi> from her Tower ſhewed me a high Hill, whereon was Luilt a marvellous ſumptuous City, and ſhe told me it was the City of Heaven, wherein is comprehended true Bleſſedneſs and perfect Felicity. In that City I ſaw never a Temple, which made
<pb facs="tcp:102717:56"/>me marvel, untill that <hi>Faith</hi> told me, that the Lord God Almighty was the Temple of that City. There needs no ſhining of the Sun, no brightneſs of the Moon, no glittering of the Stars, to give them light, for Almighty God is their true Light himſelf. None enters into this City, but ſuch as are written in the book of Life. Furthermore, <hi>Faith</hi> told me, that there was no Adverſity, no ſin, no iniquity, no fear, no ſorrow, no ſhame, no darkneſs, no pain, no unquietneſs, no ill, no grudging: finally, nothing that ſavoureth of mortality: but there was Proſperity, Perfection, Vnity, Love, Gladneſs, Quietneſs, Charity, ſure Reſt, perpetual Felicity, and everlaſting joy in God, with eternal Happineſſe. There was mirth without Sadneſs, Reſt without Pain, Abundance without Want, Life without Corruption. In this City God is ſeen Face to Face, there is the endleſs light ſhining, the Saints alwayes ſinging, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Souls rejoycing, and ever beholding God, yet ſtill coveting to ſee him, without dulneſs of deſtre. The Citizens of this City of Heaven are Co-heirs of the eternal Deity, the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt. They are made immortal, according to the promiſe of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, ſaying: <hi>Father, thoſe that thou haſt given me, I will that they be with me where I am, that they may ſee my brightneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What can I ſay more? In this City is our King without death and without change: without beginning, and without Ending. In this City there is no Night, there is no limitation or term of life, but continual day moſt brightly ſhinning. For in this City dwelleth the Father of Lights, even God himſelf, whoſe brightneſs no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can over-ſhadow. The Citizens of this City are partakers of unſpeakable grace, of endleſs joy, and of ſuch perſection as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto there can be added no more. Vnto this place ſhall the juſt be advanced: as for the wicked, their promotion is in the Lake voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Fire and Brimſtone.</p>

                     <p>The deſire that the Knight had to come to Heaven, and how Gods Grace brought perſeverance.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving ſeen from the Tower of <hi>faith,</hi> the City of Heaven, and heard (by her) the manner of it, I was raviſhed of my wit, and eſteemed nothing at all of the World: For I ſelt not my ſelf; methought I was walking in Heaven: Hereupon I deſtred <hi>Faith</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:102717:57"/>that I might remain ſtill in her Tower, the which willingly ſhe granted me, inſomuch that I was never weary out of her lower Window to behold Heaven: yea, the more I beheld it, the more beautifull it ſeemed. Then I was loath to live in this World, and deſired, that I might dye, the ſooner to have the ſight and enjoying of Chriſt my Redeemer: and kneeling by my ſelf all alone, I made this Prayer, ſaying:
<q>O How happy is the ſoul that is out of this earthly priſon, and reſteth in Heaven moſt joyfull, ſeeing his Saviour face to face! That ſoul, is without fear and affliction. O how happy is the ſoul which is in the company of Angels and holy Saints, ſinging pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes unto the Moſt High! Such a Soul ſurely is laden with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of joy. O happy ſociety of Citizens. O happy company of Saints, which lamented in their mortall life, but now raigne with God immortally. O ſweet Jeſus, let me come to thy pleaſant City, where thy Citizens ſee thee daily, to their great delight. O let me come there where nothing is troubleſome to hear or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: what melody hear they without ending! And how happy were I, if I might hear the Songs, or be admitted to ſing a Song of <hi>David</hi> in the holy Hill of <hi>Sion.</hi> O that I being the leaſt of thy Servants, may by thy grace put off my fleſhly burthen, and come to thy happy City, to accompany the holy and happy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Saints, to ſee the glory of my Creatour, and to behold his amiable Majeſty. That I may be made meet for this ſo ſweet a bleſſing, grant I beſeech thee O gracious God, that I never look back upon this ſhadow or valley of tears, that I remember not the falſe pleaſures of this wicked world, that I eſteem not this corruptible and evill life. O how can we here be happy, where the Devill alwayes aſſaults us? where the world flatters us? where the ſoul is blinded? and where all men ſinne? After which great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills, death doth follow, as the very end of all vain pleaſures, and then they are eſteemed as if they had never been. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence may be made unto thee (O God) which giveſt us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in the midſt of all our extrencities by the wonderfull vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation of they Divine Grace? Behold me miſerable wretch filled with ſadneſs, when I conſider my ſins, when I fear thy judgments, when I think on the hour of death, when I remember the pains of Hell, when I am ignorant what puniſhment I deſerve, when I know not where nor in what Eſtate I ſhall end my dayes: In all theſe
<pb facs="tcp:102717:57"/>things and many other, I appeal to thy gracious goodneſs, knowing that thou art ready to give me conſolation againſt all theſe ſorrowes. Thou lifteſt up my ſoul (full of anguiſh) above all Mountains, thou makeſt me receive thy great love, charity, and goodneſſe, by the which thou recreateſt my heavie ſpirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceſt my ſad heart, in revealing unto me thy heavenly delights.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Prayer ended, I reſted my Soul upon the anchor of hope. Then as I was kneeling, <hi>Gods grace</hi> appeared unto me, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with another Lady, which I had not ſeen before. And after I had given her thanks for all her benefits, ſhe delivered me this Lady named <hi>Perſeverance,</hi> to continue with me, charging me on keep her with me, if I meant to be a Citizen of Heaven. For (ſaid ſhe) all other vertues without her are as nothing to win braven: For it is written, <hi>who ſo perſeveres unto the end ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And therefore if thou wilt be ſaved then muſt continue. Hereof we have many Examples in the holy Scripture, but I will only touch two. When <hi>Saul</hi> was firſt annoynted King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he was as lowly as the child of one year old, but he continued not above two years in his goodneſs: For after he had once put <hi>Perſeverance</hi> away, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came evill, and grew to be a cruell Tyrant: inſomuch that he ſlue many of the Lords Prieſts, and perſecuted good <hi>David.</hi> But what was his end? He was vanquiſhed of his Enemies, and being given over of God, he killed himſelf upon the Mount <hi>Gilboa.</hi> Again. touching the ſame matter, <hi>Judas</hi> at the firſt when God made him an Apoſtle, was good and dutifull, but when he had put <hi>Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> away, he became a Thief, and by Covetouſneſs he vetrayed and ſold his Maſter Chriſt: and being forſaken of God, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Reprobate, fell into deſperation, and with a Halter hanged himſelf. When I heard <hi>Perſe verance</hi> ſay ſo, for fear leſt the like ſhould befall me, I deſired the counſell of <hi>Good Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> to ſhew me the means how I might keep <hi>Perſeverance</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with me, that in ſo doing I might not be deprived of the glorious City of Heaven. To which requeſt of mine the good Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> tendring the ſafety of my Soul, and having a carefull regard to all my Endeavours, did yield, and ſpake to me on this wiſe.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Good Underſtanding ſheweth the Knight how to keep perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance alwayes with him,</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>MY Son, the laſt point of thy Souls health (quoth <hi>Good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi>) is to know how thou art now, without going back, which if thou deſire, then muſt <hi>Perſeverance</hi> never leave thee, for if ſhe forſake thee, then muſt thou needs loſe the pleaſures of Lady <hi>Vertues</hi> Palace, wherein thou art now. From whence if thou go back, thou ſhalt be ſure to loſe the joyes of Heaven. Thou muſt therefore remain conſtant without wavering; the which to do, thou muſt by devour and continual prayer faithfully crave helpof <hi>Gods grace.</hi> And to accompliſh all this thou muſt remember three things: the firſt is, thy Life paſt: the ſecond, thy life preſent: and the third, thy liſe to come. Thoſe three confiderations will encourage thee to ſtay where thou art, and as it were with a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle will keep thee from recoyling.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, think what thou haſt done before time, in following <hi>Folly,</hi> how thou livedſt vainly, yielding to every vain concupiſcence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou didſt fall into the filth of ſin, and endangeredſt both thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul. O where hadſt thou been, if <hi>Gods Grace</hi> had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken compaſſion upon thee? Where be the Worldlings the would not be ſorry for their ſins? Where are they become? Are they not condemned to everlaſting torment in Hell fire? O think then that ſin doth greatly offend God: Think what puniſhment God hath ordained for ſin, which makes Man an Enemy to God, and a friend to the Devil.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, think that at this preſent time thou art in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by the means of his Grace, who made thee a child of God, and an Heir of Heaven, by Hope, ſo that now thy Conſcience is quiet. Think what good Conſolation thou haſt received by devour prayer: think what ſpiritual inſtructions <hi>Gods Grace</hi> hath given to thee: think all the pleaſures of the World are mingled with Sorrow: think that this World ſhall paſs away, with all the pomps and pleaſures of the ſame: think that thy preſent Eſtate is the high way to Heaven, and ſo ſhalt thou keep <hi>perſeverance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, think that the juſt judgment of God is to come, which is, <hi>to the good to give Heaven, and to the evill Hell.</hi> Think thou muſt dye, and that at thy death thou ſhalt not receive ſo good conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as thou haſt had of Vertue and <hi>Gods grace.</hi> Think that at thy death thou muſt leave behind thee. Wife, Children, Goods and
<pb facs="tcp:102717:58"/>Mony, whether thou do good or evill. Think that thou muſt go to a Region unknown, and to a place where thou haſt never been: and if thou be ſound to have dyed in ſin, without repentance, the Devils will attend to take thy damned Soul, and will carry it into the dungeon of Darkneſs, there to ſeel eternal torments. But if thou be ſound with <hi>Perſeverance</hi> in the Palace of <hi>Vertue,</hi> millions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels will go before thee, and with great joy will bring thee to heaven.</p>
                  <p>O think upon the juſt judgment of God to come, when every one ſhall be judged according to his deeds. For God fahoureth neither Kings, Princes, nor People, high nor low, rich nor poor, without reſpect of perſons be will chuſe the good, and condemn the evil, at the day of doom, when we muſt appear perſonally without excuſe or exception before him: then every man muſt be his own Atturney when the juſt Iudge at that day will ſhew himſelf terrible to the Perverſe,, which have followed <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> and have not heartily repented; but will be gentle, mercifull, and good unto thoſe that have been ſorry for their offences. O think what torments the un-repentant ſhall ſuffer both in body and ſoul perpetually: whereas all ſuch as have perſevered in goodneſs to the end, ſhall receive joy, and the fulneſs of God and of Heaven. In ſuch ſort to perſevere in goodneſs to the end, do thine utter endeavour, and thou ſhalt ſee that God will be ready with his grace, to arm thee with conſtancy in thy <hi>Chriſtian</hi> purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>MY Son, alwayes I wiſh thee to keep <hi>perſeverance</hi> with thee, by whom thou mayeſt avoid temptations, which would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thee to ſin, and force thee to forſake the true Faith, and alſo to tranſgreſs the holy Commandements of Almighty God.

<pb facs="tcp:102717:59"/>to keep thy holy Commandements, which heretofore I have wilfully and careleſſy tranſgreſſed, wherefore I am ſorry, and do heartily repent me for the breach of them: and in token thereof I make my Confeſſion, ſaying:
<q>I Believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth. And in Jeſus Chriſt his only Sonne our Lord, which was conceived by the holy Ghoſt.

                           <item>2. Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven image, nor the likeneſſe of any thing that is in Heaven above, nor in the Earth beneath, nor in the water under the Earth. Thou ſhalt not bow down to them, nor worſhip them. For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, and viſit the ſins of the Fathers upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and ſhew mercy unto thouſands in them that love me, and keep my commandements.</item>

                           <item>4. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day, ſix dayes ſhalt thou labour and doe all that thou haſt to do: but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou ſhalt do no manner of work, thou and thy ſon, and thy daughter, thy

                  </p>
                  <p>Then conſidering the tenour of that which thou haſt ſaid, crave grace at Gods hands to walk after his will, uſing the ſame prayer which Chriſt taught thee, and ſaying:
<q>Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdome come. Thy will be done in Earth as it is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Give us this day our daily bread.

                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides all this, thou muſt alſo moſt heartily humble thy ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, acknowledging thy ſelf a ſinner, and that thou canſt do nothing that is righteous: but if there be any goodneſs in thee ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Nature, or of <hi>Gods Grace,</hi> thou muſt ſreely confeſs that all comes from above. Repute not thy ſelf better than another, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the leaſt of all: If any deſpiſe thee, mock thee, or injure thee, ſuffer it not only patiently, but alſo willingly, and gladly, even for the love of God. For the ſealing Ladder of Heaven is Humility, &amp; a full denying of thy ſelf in worldly cauſes. Think not well of thy ſelf for any thing that thou doeſt, haſt done, or mayeſt do: but if thou haſt any goodneſs in thy body, or in thy ſoul, be not aſhamed to confeſs that it is not thine, becauſe it comes not from thee, but of God: for from him indeed it proceeds. And when at any time thou findeſt thy ſelf as it were leſt of God, and deſtitute of conſolation, whether it be inwardly or outwardly, be not diſcouraged for it, neither think that God hath Forgotten thee, but heartily Humble thy Self
<pb facs="tcp:102717:60"/>before God, putting all thy confidence in God, as in one that knows how to ſave his Elect. If thou receive any bleſſing inwardly, as Wiſdom, or any other gift, exalt not thy ſelf in pride, neither diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend others that have not received of God ſuch grace: but uſe that which thou haſt to Gods glory. Again, if thou ſee thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour fall, take heed, judge him not, but think, that God permits thee to ſee his effence for thy profit. Imagine thou waſt never touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that crime, well, it is much, but yet thou haſt been culpable in ſome other as bad, or elſe worſe: upon this examination reform thy ſelf: ſuppoſe thou art in no fault, thou muſt not therefore eſteem thy ſelf better than he that is in fault, knowing thou art of ſuch a nature as he is, and made of the ſame ſtuff as he is, and therefore notwithſtanding thy ſuppoſition, a ſinner and offender, as well as he; ſo that both need amending. Be thou ſure, that if God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided no better for thee than thy ſelf deſerved, thou hadſt committed the like offence, or elſe greater: and thank God for that he hath kept thee ſo, and pray for him that doth amiſſe, and is not yet converted. When thou ſeeſt a ſinner only led to loſe his life by Law, know that thou ſtandeſt a ſinner before God as well as he, although before the world thou be eſteemed better. There is no School wherein a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may ſo well learn to live well, as in the contemplation of Chriſts life and converſation: thou muſt oftentimes think on thy laſt end, as Death, Iudgement, Hell, and Heaven, perſevere in Prayer, ſo ſhalt thou pleaſe God, and not be loath to die. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy end (ſaith the wife Man) and thou ſhalt never ſin: thou muſt often pray deboutly to God, and when thou wilt ſo do, thou muſt draw thy ſelf from all affairs: for Prayer is a lifting up of the heart to God, and a private ſpeech of the ſoul with God. If it be ſo, were there any reaſon, that a man ſhould draw his cogitations from God, or rather (all outward buſineſſe put apart) with all reverence to ſubmit thy ſoul before him. All this notwithſtanding, it is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in all our affairs to pray and ſing Pſalms to Gods glory, and oftentimes with Tears to ſay the Lords Prayer, or any other Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to that effect. And here by the way thou muſt underſtand, that the longeſt Prayer is not the profitableſt, becauſe of the multitude of cogitations of the minde, beſides that thou muſt be devout, for the prayers which are done with devotion of the heart do profit, all other prayers are but vain, and to no purpoſe. If thou pronounce but three words as the Publican did, ſaying, <hi>God be mercifull to
<pb facs="tcp:102717:60"/>me a ſinner:</hi> or as the Canaanite ſaid, <hi>O Son of David have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon me,</hi> it is enough: Again, be not curious of thy tongue, nor line in ſpeaking: it ſufficeth that thy heart ſpeaks within thee, and thy tongue though but bleatingly, if unfainedly, it is well, as we read of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Anna, Samuels</hi> Mother.</p>
                  <p>Worldly goods ſuperſſuonſly thou oughteſt not to ask, but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, and with meaſure, for thy bodily health, and for the ſuccour of the needy. If thou be ſick, poor, or in adverſity, thou mayſt ask Health, Riches, or Proſperity, ſo it be done to Gods glory. But if thy aſſlictions do more advance Gods glory than thy proſperity doth, (yeelding thy ſoill to Gods will) thou oughteſt to ask Patience, and ſay with a meek heart, Lord, thy will be done, and not mine. I thy ſenſes be inclined to ſin, be not diſmayed, for there is a God, to whom if thou pray, he will by the power of his grace ſuppreſſe that inclination. Wherefore take courage when thou art tempted, ask help of God, ſaying, <hi>O God make ſpeed to ſave me, O Lord make haſte to help me: Lord God leave me not, but be my help, O thou Lord God of my health.</hi> Do what thou canſt to reſiſt the Devil, and he ſhall go from thee: approach unto God by Faith, and be will draw near unto thee by his Spirit: If the Devil aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault thee, deſy him, and make thy moan to thy Saviour, ſaying, Lord help me, and be with me. Do thou thy endeavour, and aſſure thy ſelf that God will make thee ſtrong, he will aid thee, he will eaſe thee, and in the end will ſet thee free from all verations, placing thee in the Heaven of Heavens, the Portion and Inheritance of his Servants. To this God, and to Ieſus Chriſt, with the holy Ghoſt, he all glory, honour, and praiſe, world without end. Amen.</p>

                  <p>I Thank Almighty God of his goodneſſe that I am come to the End of the Voyage of the wandring Knight: by the which thou maveſt underſtand, that in following <hi>Folly</hi> and vain <hi>Voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> he forſook God, to the prejudice and hurt of his Soul, yea, to the danger of everlaſting damnation. Here thou mayeſt learn that all voluptuous worldlings are the very Subjects of Sathan, and their earthly goods and worldly pleaſures ſhall quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume. Thou art taught likewiſe what great clemency God uſed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">

                     </gap>m, drawing him by his grace from the ſink of ſin, wherein he
<pb facs="tcp:102717:61"/>was ſunk: how he was led to the Palace of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and from thence to the Palace of <hi>Vertue,</hi> where by <hi>Gods grace</hi> he is now, and what goodneſſe he hath found there, thou haſt heard at large. The Lord grant us to land where he is landed, even in the Land promiſed to the Elect. Amen.</p>
                  <p>And now to conclude, I beſeech your courteſies, that if any thing in this my labour miſlike you, interpret the ſame to the beſt, and lay nothing to my charge in the way of preſumption: but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending my good meaning, and allowing my will, not to contemn, but to ſpeak well and eſteem of this my Work, and to uſe it for thy benefit and edincation, for the which end I made and compiled the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And now, I exhort you all (in Chriſtian love and charity) that if by Gods grace you be reſident in <hi>Vertues</hi> Palace, to perſevere and continue there to the end, humbling your ſelves before God, and allwayes truſting unto his goodneſſe, not unto our own ſtrength or merits: acknowledging alſo <hi>Gods grace,</hi> by the which you are as you are, and of whom you have that you have. Let all your conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be in his mercy and in his goodneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, if any feel and perceive himſelf out of <hi>Vertues</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, by the means of wordly vanities, let him conſider the great peril he is in, and ſpeedily turn to repentance, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite and ſorrowfull heart, requiring pardon of God, and truſting wholly in the merits and paſſion of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt. Let him not be aſhamed to acknowledge his ſins, which if he do, he ſhall finde at Gods hands grace and mercy. And now I beſeech nor Lord God to give us all Grace, to do according unto that which is here ſpoken, (for otherwiſe of our ſelves it is not poſſible) that leading a life acceptable and agreeable unto his holy will, we may in the end, after the Voyage which we have to paſſe in this world, ſee and enjoy, poſſeſſe and have the full fruition of that glorious city of Paradiſe, where true Bleſſedneſſe and perfect Felicity welleth, even in the Habitation of God Almighty: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom be all Honour, Glory, Power, and Dominion, for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Amen.</p>
